review/summary: First album I've bought since Napster
review/text: We've come a long way since the days of Ninetendo synthesized music! I say without exaggeration that the Chrono Cross Original Soundtrack is probably some of the best instrumental music I've ever heard. Yasunori Mitsuda incorporates so many instruments and musical styles to this collection, it's a real credit to his talent. Guitars, violins, cellos and the piano are just a few of the instruments at play here. Although they differ greatly in musical style, I have to draw an analogy between Mitsuda's music here to the songs of the Grateful Dead: on this album there is a song for every mood.I would recommend this album to those who enjoyed playing the Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross series, as well as those who are Final Fantasy fans. I stumbled across this music while downloading other video game music off the Internet, and I don't regret spending the money on this album at all. A great deal of care has been given to this music and it really shows in the end product. Anyone who enjoys good music will find it here.Maybe the best tribute to a musician isn't critical acclaim, but emulation by the fans. I've come across sheet music, remixes and covers of Mitsuda's work on this album, all done by fans as tribute and the desire to perform such music for themselves. This album is good stuff. Frankly I hope Mitsuda makes more.
