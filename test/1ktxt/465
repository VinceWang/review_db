review/summary: Hours of fun!
review/text: I bought this for my 5 1/2 year old and she and her 4 year old sister play with it all the time. My younger daughter is also having trouble with the maze but she still loves everything else. This also has educational and problem solving games. Overall, if your little girl loves Barbie or princesses she will be fascinated by this game. I'm pretty impressed with the quality of it, too. Definitely worth the money!!
