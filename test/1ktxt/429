review/summary: great classic jacket
review/text: This is the second time I have bought this jacket. I wore the first one out! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman. I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size. This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old.
