review/summary: Classic toy
review/text: I had this toy as a little girl and he went everywhere with me and slept with me every night. I gave mine to my boys when they were little and unfortunately I didn't pay enough attention and they tore him up. I've been wanting to buy another one just as a nostalgia thing for a long time. My husband finally bought him for me and I love him! I didn't get the classic, I did get the new version. He is slightly different from the old, classic version. His name tag is a bit different as is his coloring, nose, etc. But he is unbelievably soft and cuddly. I also bought one for my great-niece and nephew. Definitely recommend this product.
