review/summary: Plush Henry Dog
review/text: I bought this for my brother who is 35 years old- when he was growing up, this was his favorite toy and he still has his original, but, after 30 years, he has seen better days!!! I came across it accidentally online and thought it would be a "funny" gift for him.I ordered this and was quite surprised that i received it so promptly- within 48 hours of purchase i had it-This was even nicer than i expected- soft and plush and a great toy-Needless to say, my brother was pleasantly surprised and quite amused to receive this at Christmas!!!
