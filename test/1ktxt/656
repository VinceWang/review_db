review/text: Don't usually purchase shoes without trying them on first and I should have stuck with my rule. They are advertised as a Wide, but actually they didn't feel like it. The quality of the shoe is Wonderful and the shoe is really cute. I think it would be great for the average foot. I'm wondering since they put elastic in the shoe, that's what they considered "wide". Since I wore it once, I probably can't return it. If you have a regular width foot, I'd order this. Cute shoe!
