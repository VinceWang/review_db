review/text: Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus... :) I got this Henry for my little son 4 years ago. Of course, he's been my son's night companion ever since. We've taken him everywhere in our travels (and we do travel). Also sometimes poor Henry has to withstand some rough play during the day... I am not sure he will hold up for 40 years as the old ones did, but he's doing fine for now. This is a great toy.
