review/summary: Finally the investment pays off...!
review/text: I am finding out that my 10 years old copy of Dramatica may be worth Something. I know about Armando from early adopters and listserve participants. I have poured over many times my dogeared notes of Instant dramatica before....Then I got distracted but knew this book was coming...That was 2005...but I am starting with this book now.I am at just part 3 of the book now and I am already feeling like a skilled storyteller.Thanks to Armando for sharing invaluable wealth of PRO information getting me back on the road....And restoring my belief in usefulness of Dramatica.....
