review/text: This is an amazing blend of hot beats and a good rapper. It's underground, so many of you might be nervous about buying it. But, I'll tell you, Pokey sounds a lot like Biggie Smalls (BIG). He has biggie's style, usin words like sho nuff. Pokey's lyrics are good, but a few lyrics could use a little work. A few of his songs have complex beats, but most have a little bit of a more simple beat. The album comes together great. Get it! Trust me...its worth the money
