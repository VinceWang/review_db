review/summary: I've lived this game!
review/text: I got this game, and the IT Expansion pack, deeply discounted at a game store. I must say that this is the first card game that I can actually relate to from personal experience. What fun. If you work in an office, and especially if you work in the IT department, this may be a fun game to play during lunch (in the rare event you do actually get to not work during lunch) or "after hours" with your friends. It will probably get old after a few plays, as the gags and cartoons are really funny only the first time one sees them, but it's great to play this game at least once just for laughs.
