review/summary: A fine effort by a mainly forgotten star
review/text: Story goes that after a number of excellent second horn sessions on mid 60's Blue Note where flute.alto,and soprano were wielded masterfully by James Spaulding he was given a shot as a leader.He was the non star(leader) that was called in many,many times.But at the point he got his offer Direction/Production had switched from Alfred Lion to Francis Wolff and A&R; fro Ike Quebec to Duke Pearson.Bottom line was they offered Spaulding a shot if he would fit into the new funky blues idiom of the Liberty era and he refused not being true to the hard bop form.Well even though he recorded few albums as a leader latter on labels like Muse("Smile Of The Snake" and "Blues Nexus are also fine 4 star or better efforts).He he has and excellent session with Wallace Ronney on trumpet,Mulgrew Miller and Ron Carter on bass, and Kenny Washington on drums.Fine line up.And though there are so many Monk tribute Lp's it is the musicianship wielded with passion that makes this a cut of above.As mentioned his flute playing is fine.I find jazz flute hit or miss and here it just works fine.Not a direct copy of the Monk style it shows th timeless of the compositions (not that a total analogue LP with some personal character is bad-see Walter Davis Jr. piano solo "In Walked Thelonius").I'd call this no an essential Lp but for Monk fans it may be.CheersChazz
