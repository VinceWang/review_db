review/text: Product arrived on the third day after I ordered, despite a delivery estimate of 7-10 days. I'm impressed with both the product and the marketplace seller (PrimeNetShops). The screen came well packaged, and in good shape. One of the decorative knobs on top had come unscrewed and was in the bottom of the box, but it re-attached with ease. It's light enough that it can be moved with ease, but still feels sturdy enough that it should last for years to come. Great product, great experience. Everything that is right about Amazon, all in one order!
