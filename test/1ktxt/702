review/summary: KING JAMES is awsome
review/text: My story is about LeBron James and how he grew up. When he was a freshman in high school he won tournament MVP for the state, which is amazing.The beginning starts at his childhood and continues so on. My favorite part in the book is when he's a freshman and he played football. Their team made it to state. They lost in the finals, but he got All State. That means hes one of the best in the state. Later that year he made the basketball team. They made it to the state finals. They won and LeBron got MVP. That happened for the next three years.Ryan Jones is a senior editor at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine. He lives in New York. I would recommend this book to sports fans that like LeBron James. The age and gender I would recommend this book to is ages 13-35 and boys.
