review/summary: Problems with internet - but a good magazine
review/text: I received "free" access to the BA web page (all links) with my subscription...however, about every 3rd time I logged on, my username was declared invalid. I had to contact them several times before the problem was fixed. (It was fixed three times, and then it would fail again). The customer service people were friendly and helpful, but it was a little painful to have to keep asking for help.Outside of that - this is a great publication for people that are into fantasy baseball leagues that allow you to draft minor leaguers - or "long term keeper" leagues....or if you are just a fan of baseball and really like to learn a lot about the up and coming player.I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the internet problem.....
