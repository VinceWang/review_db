review/summary: The truth about WOTWS
review/text: I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !!
