review/summary: a bibliophiliac wedding of the SURREALIST &amp; the OCCULTIST
review/text: Kurt Seligmann, Surrealist artist par excellence, admitted &amp; unashamed bibliophile, has ravaged his occult library in a miraculous marriage giving birth to this classic historical account of Magic and Occultism; entirely written for the proverbial 'man about the street', and a very cosmic avenue is here tread in an admireable chronological ordering of the various mystical houses. Addressing all the various occult(semantic definition of &quot;hidden &amp; rejected knowledge&quot;) routes via the shortcut of this Art Historian's scholarly mind, as a whole this work is one of the best and most easily approachable &quot;magic histories&quot; for those who have no previous knowledge concerning occultism except an undeniable interest and fascination with the mysterious and the spiritual.Kurt Seligmann is darkly fascinated and explores endlessly the multitude of historic beliefs concerning the study of the nature of evil... such as black magic, necromancy, Elizabethian era conjurers and their Enochian magic,primitive rites, evocations of the Cultus Satanus, Goetia Demonomania, et.al....as an example, early on he discusses Chaldean phliosophies in which: &quot;Evil was born from God's disturbing thoughts&quot;...I have long wondered if the proposed thoughts had to do specifically with humanity?...and this book will surely set the fire or fan the sulphurous flames of those burning to know more about all things occult.The book primarily deals with Western Esoteric Traditions, which, being a westerner, appeals to my insatiable explorative appetite in studying and discovering the divinity of humankind and the accorded propensity &amp; potentials of individual spiritual progress through Magick and the strengthening of divine will ; in comparison with more Eastern idealogies concerned with mystical enlightenment and the abolishing of the ego to attain Nirvana.In summation, Kurt Seligmann, as one of the last efforts of his exemplary artistic journey throughout the early 20th century avant-garde, has given the world a completely unbiased in-depth world history from a magical perspective, a genuine labor of love which will always retain its intimately artistic personality in contrast to the strict scholarly treatise of the newspaper skeptic variety; and although there are better, more developed and intrigueing accounts out there, none are at the moment so readily available and economic, nor so expressive, or conclusively compact as this. Finally, the book has over a hundred and fifty illustrations from alchemical treatise and magical grimoires which compliment his descriptive writing style.It is besides all this, another exclamation point punctuating the Surrealist movement. surrealyours, an occultist.
