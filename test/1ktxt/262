review/summary: 5 SOLID Stars!!. Very exquisite music.
review/text: I'm very happy to have in my hands one of the best CD's of this new Millennium.Back in 2005 when I heard Jerome was going to release his first solo I said: "I don't know. Lets wait and see...". I WAS WRONG.When I got my "Neptunes" CD nobody was at home that day. So, I took a time to relax, drink my orange juice with some drops of bitter almond extract and put my sound system to perform without blowing out any window.Track one. What a beautiful tack!. The best introduction for a great CD.Track two. Great!.Track three. Fantastic!.Track four. Ok, it blown-out my senses. "This track worth the whole CD", I said. But wait, there are more, a lot more.Almost 80 minutes of exquisite music. Tacks 8 and 10 are as good as tracks 4 and 1."Neptunes" reminds me the same feelings I had when I listened "Underwater Sunlight" for the first time back in 1986."Neptunes" music is something like "Mars Polaris" mixed with "DM4" and "DM2: Timesquare".Yes, it is that good.Hats off to Jerome Froese.Eduardo Nava. Mexico City.
