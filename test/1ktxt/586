review/summary: one georgia boy reviews another
review/text: first off,yes these are rerecordings.each studio has its own unique sound.i thought tommy roe's voice was great when these were recorded in 1981.to me there is some mystery about the place and time of these of these particular recordings and who owns them. i have always thought they were recorded in gusto studios in 1981. the original gusto album did not give much info about the recording of the songs.these same particular recordings have popped up on at least five different cds by five different companies. sometimes i wonder if mr. tommy roe does not own them.if you are looking for the original recordings check elsewhere. i wish roe had done'winters day', 'sweet sounds',and even'moon talk'.tommy will always do a good job. i would love to have seen tommy roe, billy joe royal,and joe south when they performed in plains a number of years back.check out billy joe royal on 'studio 102 essentials'. billy joe will sing anybody's songs and pull it off. with the stuff they use-they can't lose.------richard bennett-south georgia-next to juniors junk yard.you might wonder if i am on shine after reading my reviews-well who knows?
