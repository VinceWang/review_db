review/summary: UniFlame 4 Fold Polished Brass and Black Fireplace Screen
review/text: This is an excellent fireplace screen for the price. I was somewhat surprised at how light the screen is as compared to other fireplace screens I have in the house. You certainly won't have a hard time moving it away from the fireplace. I actually purchased it to put in front of a gas fireplace in order to make the fire look more authentic and it does the job !
