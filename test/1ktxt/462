review/summary: Wonderful game for 3 and 4 year old girls
review/text: My daughters both love this game. Aged 3 and 4, they're already fairly adept computer users, but this game is really particularly well designed for their ages. They love the story line (somewhat different from the movie) and the challenge of having to find all the gems to save the prince. The activities in the game are ones that they play over and over - especially the painting, mosaic puzzle, and design-your-own flowers. They really get to use their creativity, and the tools they can use in the game are really beautiful. We have a lot of kids' computer games, and this one is their hands-down favorite.
