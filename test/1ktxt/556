review/summary: CLEAR AND INSPIRING EXPLANATION OF SPIRITUAL TREATMENT
review/text: Dr Baker explains clearly and engagingly how one can improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called treatment. The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alia, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy, Catherine ponder and Florence Scovel-Shinn, this book should be read repeatedly to provide the maximum benefit.
