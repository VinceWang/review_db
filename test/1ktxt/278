review/summary: too hip for dry toed squares
review/text: This disc is not of this world... its from a beach next door. Recorded on a bluff overlooking the pacific ocean its surf music for the toes in the know... not for everyone just those that know the sun sets in the west and the nwind is always offshore on the fall groundswells... don't miss the vibe ;)
