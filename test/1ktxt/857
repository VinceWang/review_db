review/summary: Picture Quality Still Holds Up
review/text: I bought this Handycam 10 years ago. I stopped using it for whatever reason. But I recently set out to convert the video I had taken with this to digital. Not only was it easy, but the quality of the picture was amazing...even playing it on my 40 inch screen. The image is so much better than my phone new camcorder.
