review/summary: Nobou can't compare
review/text: As a frequent player of RPG's I have listened to many RPG soundtracks, not counting that I've beaten many. But, I must say that in comparison to the Final Fantasy Series (I own 7, 8, 9, and 10 and have played all of them) Chrono Cross easily wins in gameplay and its music. The music seems to perfectly go along with the plot. It is moving and inspiring to keep playing, which is helpful 'cause it took me like 8 hours to figure-out how to get that hydra stuff for Kid and the music continued to reassure me to keep playing.So, you can understand how I feel about this soundtrack, and if you're gonna buy the soundtrack and you don't have the game, which would be awkward, buy the game! Have fun! RPG on!
