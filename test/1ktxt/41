review/summary: Classical, Tropical , Soothing man this CD has everything
review/text: Since i dont have much time to write this review ill just say this. This Cd might be the best relaxing CD you will ever hear, my friends who listen to Enya were skeptical when i told them that this Cd was better, but when they heard Another World theme, they were hooked. All i can say is that even if you dont like relaxing music, you should still buy it to admire how great the quality of the music is(for a PSX game) and how much effort Mitsuda put n it.
