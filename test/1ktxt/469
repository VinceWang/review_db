review/summary: Great Game for Little Girls
review/text: My girls, 5 and 6, love this game. They have had it for about a year, and continue to play it at least once a week. Its not particulary educational, but not everything has to be. The maze at the end is difficult for my younger one, but my 6 year old will step in and help her with it. Overall, I highly recommend this software.
