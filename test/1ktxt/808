review/summary: disappointing...
review/text: I looked forward to watching this movie, but was disappointed. Overall it is well made, but the representation of St. Francis was at best disappointing. I realize St. Francis's life was not a bed of roses, but there was almost no joy *AT ALL* in his life, according to this movie. Far too much crying for his character lines.Also, it was troubling to have St. Francis represented as someone almost bordering on disobedience to the Pope when he requests approval for his order. It is one thing to speak freely but they carried it too far for the saint who "rebuilt Christ's church."
