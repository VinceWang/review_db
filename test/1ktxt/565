review/summary: Great Projects! Even for a rainy day!
review/text: A great resource for paper type crafts. From paper mache to origami this book gives you projects you can follow right from the book or inspirations for your own creations. Clear instructions and excellent step by step photos. Tried some of the projects myself with success and had fun with the kids doing it. Great for a sunny day when you want to do something different or are stuck inside on a rainy day.
