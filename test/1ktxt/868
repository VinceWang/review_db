review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I have a Sony Ericsson K700i, which doesn't sell in the US, but after I received the USB Data Cable I have some troubles installing it but soon after those we're resolved I worked great, I'm very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend this product and any other from MyNetDeals (electro_island), it's really a very big save from buying direct from Sony Ericsson. Thanks!.
