review/summary: NOW... That's what I Call Electro-rock
review/text: Practically ignored by music criticism (even by indie critics), this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like crap (by the way, I love DFA)... Soulwax has always been a rock band as oposed to their alias "2 many djs" that is used for electronic work, remixing and DJing. But this record takes the better of both names, Soulwax remixed (or re-created) their own songs and if that was not enough they open the album with an amazing rock cover of Daft Punks's "Teachers". 2manyDJS has also been known for their bastard pop tracks, and they do it here too in songs like "NY Lips" (sampling Funky town in a much more "funky" way than the original)... Potent beats and basslines are heard all over the songs, samples and lyrics are funny and fascinating.My humble advice: buy this record... now!
