review/summary: Top class CD, but a little too long
review/text: Coming at this CD as a complete novice to Drum and Bass music, it was totally mind blowing. At last a band that could use the techniques to make a complete album. The music mixes up a variety of dance and jazz to produce a superb sound, that is both good for listening and dancing to. Kelly, the lead singer, has one of the best female voices I have heard. Her voice is both passionate and soft, but she brings a down to earth feel to every word.Unfortunately the Album is too long and like many Drum and Bass (or Dance) albums there are, as call them, filler tracks, beats and sounds that could have been used to make a complete tune. These filler tracks sound like overlong intros. I have resorted to writing down the tracks I want to listen too, so I can program my cd player.The Album moves on from their earlier stuff and produces a new style of sound with a retro feel.However no matter how many filler tracks are on this album it is definaitely worth having.Well done to E-Z rollers, look forward to the next album
