review/summary: Time to suspend judgement
review/text: This is well worth the read if only to gain information about the pods of Orcas that are resident around the San Juan Islands. But well beyond that, whether or not one accepts the author's ability to communicate with the orcas, what she relates about the wisdom of whales (primarily Granny, the 90+year old leader of J pod) is a wake-up call for humanity.
