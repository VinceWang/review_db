review/summary: good but pricey
review/text: Images are pretty, nice combination of colors, and is well done. My 4 year old daughter loves it at first and only took her a couple of hours to complete the adventure (she did need some adult help to get her started and more help to go through the maze). After that, she doesn't play with it as much ... and thus why I think it's pricey ... Not quite a learning experience as the Jump Start series.
