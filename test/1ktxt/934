review/summary: I love these blocks
review/text: I got these after seeing a friend bought them for her 2 year old. My 9 month old enjoys shaking the ones with little pieces inside (like the u for umbrella has little white pellets representing rain). I love all the thought and detail that went into each block. My friend with the older child says she loves them because you can really talk about each block with your child, instead of a regular one dimensional block. Those conversations are huge for language development, teaching colors, aninimals, a whole variety of new words, etc. Buy them! They also make a fantastic unique gift for a friends child. Very well put togethe/durable. I admit, I even enjoy looking at each one to see what the designers came up with.
