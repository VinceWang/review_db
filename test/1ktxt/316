review/text: This is Such a great book! I have a sourdough starter from a friend and this book shows you how to care for it along with wonderful recipes. There are so many great stories that even without the recipes it would be a great book. I love the muffins, they don't taste like sourdough at all! I will say that if you don't know how to bake bread you should get another book along with it. I would recommend "Beard on Bread." Don't trust him for sourdough, he dose not like it. His recipe for sourdough calls for milk with Ruth Allman says causes spoilage.
