review/text: Third Mix was, without question, one of the best mixes of DDR ever released. This CD is a full compilation of songs from that game. It's too bad you need a converter to play the Japanese DDR games on an American playstation2, but if you can't play, at least listen! Awesome songs, keep the games coming in the USA!
