review/summary: My daughter loves it!
review/text: "Santa" brought this game to my 5 year old, and she absolutely loves it! She asks to play it over & over again. She loves decorating all the rooms in the castle, saving the Prince, and picking out a ball gown for Rapunzel. She even likes the song at the beginning of the game, and has it memorized. I recommend this game for any 4-8 year old girl.
