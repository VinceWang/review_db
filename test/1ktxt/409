review/summary: Very poor quality.
review/text: The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The "finish" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid.
