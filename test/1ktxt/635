review/summary: Awesome Game for Kids
review/text: I have 5-7 year olds and they love to play this. We have the neighbors kids over and they have round robin tournaments and the 5 yr old can beat the 16 and 12 yr old neighbors because there are so many options to win. It is like tic tac toe on steroids...in a good way!
