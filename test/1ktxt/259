review/summary: "Son of Tangerine Dream" -- not to be missed
review/text: I highly concur with the reviewers below: this album is a breath of fresh air, and -- as trite as this sounds -- delicious. It's impossible to not compare, and although I would say it's more reminiscent of newer TD than older, its personal identity is what really stands out.If you've been disappointed with TD's output over the last decade, you can't go wrong by giving this album a listen. It's very nice, dreamy stuff by someone with a fresh, unjaded perspective.Well done, Jerome; please stick around, I'm really looking forward to the next album.
