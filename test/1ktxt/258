review/summary: Froese junior beats Froese senior hands down
review/text: Sensational stuff from Jerome and light years ahead of anything T Dream itself is capable of producing these days. If tracks that come from nowhere, do nothing and go nowhere are your thing, stick to T Dream and Edgar's current releases. If you like the opposite and the Dream Mixes groove of electronics, guitars and upbeat tracks then Neptunes is an absolute must. It might sound a bit new agey in places at first, but stick with it and after a few plays you'll be hooked. Track 10 - Murder Mystery Dinner Train - is probably the highlight.
