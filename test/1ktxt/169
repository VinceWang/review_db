review/summary: Great! But please read on before purchasing ext batteries!
review/text: This is simpily the best rechargable batteries I have ever own!But there is a slight issue in which is the reason why I have to return this for something else - different mAh ratings!The charger comes with 1700mAh Batteries!!! Not 1850!!!!!!I purchase this for use in my GPS/GMRS radios (which eats 3 per unit). So natually, I purchase this charger with extra Kodak Max K2000 batteries (same product name, and pretty looks the same in picture) but the problem is that the extra set is rated at 1850! I was planning to use those on my gps, but if the ratings are different, my data between the units might be incorrect.Bottom line, if 4 batteries are all you need, or you can use them in sets of 2 or all 4 at once. GO FOR IT!!! I am a gadget freak and I test many different products frequently. When it comes to batteries - this is it, hands down.
