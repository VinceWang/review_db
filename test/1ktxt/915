review/text: I bought these blocks for my daughter's first Christmas. She was 11 months old them. She turns them over and stacks them and enjoys shaking them but she gets bored too quickly and moves on to something more interactive. I am hoping that in time she will use them as an educational tool. All in all a good buy.
