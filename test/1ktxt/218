review/summary: One very useful Product for the Video Enthusiast
review/text: This is one of the newest and hottest new combination DVD/VCR combinations on the market today. Upon picking up my purchase of the HR-XVC1U I was impressed. The finish and construction of this product is first rate, and it provides just about every feature one could hope for in a combination unit. Although it does not provide progressive scan for the HD TV owner, for those of us who have a 2 to 3 year old large screen set of 32 - 36 or projection size, it performs admirably. It will play SVHS tapes, and record and play VHS with a clarity I have not seen even on my older SVHS unit. It will also record VHS and show a DVD at the same time. Hook ups and Outputs will impress even the most demanding. The DVD will play all DVD and CD formats. The Remote, it should be noted, is not Universal with the exception of other JVC products, and the Users manual was obviously written by someone with English as a second language. However, if you are able to look past these small limitations, you will not be disappointed. I highly reccomend this product.
