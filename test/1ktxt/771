review/summary: PROBABLY HANAKO OKU'S BEST KNOWN ALBUM
review/text: "Time Note" may be singer-songwriter Hanako Oku's most widely known CD. It contains her two big hits from the 2006 anime film "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time." Her songs are romantic, emotional piano ballads sung in Japanese. Every track is heart warming -- or heart BREAKING, sometimes it is hard to tell. I'm not sure if my heart is breaking or filled with joy. The playing and singing is so good, you do not have to understand Japanese to feel the emotional effect. Her voice is like an angel.This is a great album from a great artist.
