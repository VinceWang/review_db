review/summary: Alaska Sourdough Book Reivew
review/text: We purchased this book based on a recommendation to create our own sourdough "start". The book is detailed and very informative. We have enjoyed creating our own sourdough start. It is amazing that you should leave the sourdough start on the counter for up to a year to have a stronger flavor.
