review/text: I have look all over my hometown and no one carries this brand except Walmart (when they have it)...It tastes like Captain Crunch But is made by Quaker Oats and is exceptionally healthy for you.So I get the best of both worlds...Sweet and Crunchy as well as the Healthy aspect of it and not the pure sugar type...Bigger boxes would be nice though. My family has gone though 3 boxes in a matter of 1 week...Keep them coming...Thanks
