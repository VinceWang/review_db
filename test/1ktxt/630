review/summary: Super fun!
review/text: This tic-tac-toe take-off is extremely fun. Don't let the "JR" fool you. It is simple enough for my 5YO yet challenging enough for any adult. Each player gets 6 "gobblets" (2 small, 2 med, and 2 lg) to play with. We learned very quickly that part of the strategy is figuring out which size pieces to play first, but it is also important not to just "gobble" each other up since it is easy to gobble to the point where each player has just two spaces on the board. Since "gobbling" is so much fun it is hard to resist over-gobbling.This is a top-notch game, very fun to play. The gameboard and pieces are all wooden and attractively decorated. Even the box is very sturdy. This is a fun and welcome addition to our collection.
