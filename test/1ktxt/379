review/text: The Reatards' music is really something that hasn't nothing to do with common and usual comments and impressions on someone's music. This record(and their first record too)is not for everyone. All of the essence of true Punkrock, of true Rock And Roll is in their songs. I mean that their sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR. It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is the real, concrete expression of the Plato's concept of Sublime. The first feedback you have from their record is the sensation that The Reatards have an incredible urgency to express their HATE; but I really think that it actually is LOVE,LOVE,LOVE from a HEART with a DIVINE INSPIRATION. In their songs, in their screams, in their unbelievable, uncontrollable urge and fury there's a strong light from God, from Dyonisus. The covers of old punk-favorites are many, but the originals are better: &quot;Tonight it'll come&quot; stands as the &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; of the third millennium. Along with The Oblivians(from Memphis too), the best band of the 90's.
