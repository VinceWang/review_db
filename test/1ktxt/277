review/summary: Unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit.
review/text: When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last &quot;vibe&quot; Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA.
