review/summary: This is a great soundtrack
review/text: I enjoy listening to my Chrono Cross CDs. The Sound quality is grate, and as I listen the music still inspires me, and I can relive the game as I play the music at home or work. Really I just like video game music and this is one of the best soundtracks that I have now. It really has all the songs and music that are found in the game.
