review/summary: Requires too much coordination
review/text: I bought this software for my 5 year old. He has a couple of the other RH software games and he likes them a lot. This game, however, was too challenging for him. The biggest problem I see is that the game requires the child to be able to maneuver the vehicle using all 4 scroll keys on the keyboard. During one exercise, which by the way you can't get to the next level until you complete this exercise, the game requires that you use the keys to move while watching out for falling lava rocks and clouds, monitor a fuel gauge, watch arrow indicators that help you determine where objects are in the arena below, and watch a scope that shows animals when you're hovering over the top of them.I tried to perform this exercise myself and got frustrated. It's just too hard to expect even a 7 year old to complete this exercise let alone a 5 year old.There are some exercises he can complete himself but they mostly require using the left, right keys.I don't know who this game would be good for. Parts of it would be too easy for someone 7 or older. Yet some parts are too difficult for those younger than that.
