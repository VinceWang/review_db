review/summary: Blcoks are great, but alphabet letters block what's inside.
review/text: I love peek a blocks, they're great. So I was so excited when I got these as a gift. The only problem with them is that the letters sometimes block what's inside (taking away the whole point of "peek a blocks"). Still, I think they are a great add on to any collection.
