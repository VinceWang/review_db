review/text: JMM has never released a bad album. Many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits. For some reason, radio hasn't played some of his great songs from his latest albums. &quot;Goes Good With Beer&quot; and &quot;Little Devil&quot; would be great singles to spice up country radio. &quot;Letters From Home&quot; deserves to be single of the year and &quot;Cool&quot; is not far behind. The more I listen to the album, the more I love it.
