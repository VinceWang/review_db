review/text: In lieu of a new studio album, Soulwax have done the increasingly common thing and released a remix record to quench the public's thirst for new material. Remix releases can be nasty, barrel scraping affairs (just look at the recent Le Tigre compilation for proof), but in light of the critical hiding Any Minute Now copped upon its release in 2004, it's interesting to note the favourable attention Soulwax have attracted since NY Excuse was released earlier in the year in remixed form. Although that radio-friendly track doesn't make it to Nite Versions, there's two other versions of NY Excuse on offer, with NY Lipps incorporating a smattering of Lipps, Inc's classic disco cheese Funky Town to groovy effect. While second version Another Excuse is a DFA and Soulwax collaboration, sadly the gathering of minds looks better on paper than it sounds in reality, ensuring NY Lipps and its pots and pans percussion make for the better NY Excuse remix. Elsewhere on Nite Versions Soulwax's Dewaele brothers cover Daft Punk on album opener Teachers, completely reinvent E Talking save for a bassline and add an air of volatility to Compute via the use of a harpsichord.As proven by their 2 Many DJs sideline, the Dewaeles know their way around a mix disc, with Nite Versions sampling LA Style's James Brown Is Dead on I Love Techno, adding Ultravox-style flourishes to Accidents And Compliments and seguing tracks with a perfect fusion.Next up is their production role with Canada's Tiga, but for now Nite Versions satisfactorily keeps the interest in the Belgians high.
