review/summary: A simple, reliable, compact, and fast charger
review/text: After reading the reviews, I bought this charger. It is everything the positive reviewers are saying. It is simple to use, just fold out the electric prongs and plug into a wall outlet or extension cord. In 3 hours, up to 4 NiMH AA batteries are charged (you can charge 1 to 4 batteries at a time). This charger will shut itself off when it is done charging--in 3 hours. It has lights for each battery telling you when it is charging and the lights go out to let you know that the batteries are fully charged. Since the electric prongs can fold in, the charger can easily fit into a camera bag, or pocket. It is about 2-1/2" by 5" (inches) in dimension. This is an excellent product!!!
