review/summary: Fun, simple game but challenging enough for adults
review/text: I like that kids can beat adults at this game. It's like tic tac toe but in an advanced way. It's simple enough that my 4-year-old takes a try with this (not so successfully but with a lot of fun and enthusiasim) and my 7-year-old definitely plays this well. You have to watch your moves carefully because your pieces can be covered by an opponent's piece easily (and with tic-tac-toe you don't get to cover someone's space once they've played on it, so this can be a tricky addition to the game.)Friends introduced us to this game one weekend and within 2 days I ran out and bought it myself. Easy to travel with as well...you can just pile up the pieces in a small bag and leave the wood board at home. When you get where you're going, it's easy to create the board with a piece of paper and pencil (just like a tic tac toe board.)This is a good gift item as well. Not as many people have this at home so it's one you can feel safe in buying and giving to someone as a little something unexpected. We've ordered a few as gifts and have fun teaching the game to others.
