review/summary: The Little Book that Could, and Did.
review/text: An incredible collection of stories that will make you gasp and ask for more. I originally read this book in spanish but even when it's translated, it doesn't lose any of it's magic. As you read this book and indulge in the many characters' lives, you realize that they belong to the author's imagination as much as they belong to our wonder and just as much as they belong to our own lives. After every story I had to sit back an process the incredible story I had just read. Rivera-Valdez uses her ease with words to paint not just a portrait of each character, but a landscape. Not only are you able to fully enjoy the secrets in the stories, but you will find yourself wondering what goes on behind your own neighbors' curtains.
