review/summary: Very well arranged and composed
review/text: The music contained on some of the tracks are slight remixes of previous music from the original Chrono Trigger. However, the composed songs are very well arranged and orchestrated, espeically the ones on the last disc. And unlike the Chrono Trigger soundtrack this one is not synthesized. Even the simpleist songs such as the acoustic guitar themes are a pleasure to listen to.
