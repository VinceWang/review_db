review/summary: a little-known gem
review/text: The previous reviewer said a lot of the most important things. I wanted to add that "Chasin' The Bird" has great work from all concerned, including a surprise "silent" break from the great and undersung Detroit drummer Roy Brooks, and that "I'll Remember April" is a thoroughly exhilarating performance, with one of Barry Harris' best recorded solos and great exchanges between Rodney and altoist Charles McPherson.
