review/summary: Let down slightly in places but otherwise outstanding.....
review/text: The only critiscm I have about this sound track are the two bonus tracks (which don't appear in the game and add nothing to the preceding tracks on the cds) and the strange morph that one of the tracks (I believe that it is Escape) takes, turning from a good piece of music into something that seems to have escaped from the eighties.Apart from that I can't recommend this OST highly enough, especially Disc 2 - Track 29 -Staff Roll which, unlike the other tracks on the disc, is an acoustic Strings Piece that really shows off Hitoshi Sakimoto's talents as a composer.
