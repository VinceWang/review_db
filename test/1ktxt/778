review/summary: Plush and adorable - just like I remember him!
review/text: I remember growing up with a Henry Dog and now I have a son named Henry - a perfect match! This plush puppy is soon to be a best friend and loving companion. He's soft and cuddly, just like my Henry! A quality stuffed animal with his trademark name tag and cute red tongue. If you have a "Henry" in your life or any child looking for a best friend, Henry's your dog.
