review/summary: Probably Won't Become Your Favorite Barbie Game
review/text: This Rapunzel game was not really my favorite game. It wasn't that much fun. You have to wait a long time to move to another place. And whenever you want to go someplace else you have to click arrows up and down. This game was not fun b/c when you click the arrows up and down it goes somewhere else you do not want it to be at. I would not recommend that you would buy this game. I would rather play princess fashion boutique.
