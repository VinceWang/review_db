review/summary: Blazing Brightly--God at the Center
review/text: Joy in God--necessary? Or simply optional??? John Piper explains why that if Christ is to be the sun at the center of the solar system of our lives, then He must also be our supreme joy over all other "lesser treasures." Glorifying God can only be done from a heart that is glad in God. Deep joy in God is the true foundation for all obedience; treasuring Him over all things is the only Christ-exalting motivation to endure suffering...especially to willfuly choose suffering.Show it to your Youth Group, Men's/Women's Group, or Home Bible Study. Set your church ablaze with a passion for the glory of God, in the supremacy of Christ over all things in this world. Everything being fueled by a Spirit produced joy and satisfaction in the Lord Himself--to His praise and renoun!Only because of grace,--Jeffrey
