review/summary: They're thrown, stacked, washed, banged, and not damaged!
review/text: My 15 month old hasn't gotten her hands on these yet (saving for Christmas) but her little friend has a set, and I've been told that they stand up to a LOT of abuse. Our set was sent on time, but I noticed that some of the little toys inside the blocks seem a little dirty. IDK how this could be, since the blocks are sealed so that little ones can't get into the small pieces inside. Guess I'll update this review after my little one gets her hands on these.Update, 8/5/12: My now-16 month old LOVES these little things! She's able to identify the letters through the toys inside them ("find D for ducky!"). She hasn't tried stacking them yet, but they get thrown around and scattered (one survived a throw outside onto asphalt with nary a scratch). I would recommend to anyone with an active toddler! Oh, and they also amuse them during diaper changes -- another plus!
