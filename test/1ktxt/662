review/text: Dr.Walker has written a unique,and compassionate book. It has,indeed,saved my sanity! Dr.Walker's treats his patients with tremendous sensitivity,and,with a non-judgemental insight,far beyond any other doctor that I know! I think,and believe,that Dr.Walker is a medical giant,of our time.
