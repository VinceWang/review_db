review/summary: A soundtrack you'll never forget
review/text: With everything having been said, there's nothing else for me to say except that the music of Chrono Cross has stood up well over these years and still gives me something new everytime I listen.I love this soundtrack mainly for its most heartfelt pieces; the quiet, simmering compositions that tie everything together in between its most powerful and majestic moments."The Scars of Time" is still one of the best, most original theme pieces ever, and the only one on the soundtrack (if I remember right) which Mitsuda created with acoustic, not synthesized, music. Another piece which stands out is "The Bend of Time" (a.k.a. "Ravine - Cleft of Dimension"), which is played in the game at the island where you may return to battle any of the game's creatures over again. I, however, lacking the soundtrack CD at the time, merely went there to listen to the music and let it loop in the background while I went about my business.Some time later I ordered the CD (unheard of on Amazon at the time), and six years on, "The Bend of Time" is still one of the best pieces to put on for a quiet, sunny late afternoon. When my daughter was born, "The Bend of Time," "Another Arni," "Another Guldove," and "Home Arni" made her lullaby playlist, and these are still some of her favorite pieces.What Yasunori Mitsuda has achieved here is an amazing, all-embracing sweep of the entire spectrum of human emotion. It's upbeat, victorious, adventurous, tragic, dramatic, gentle, nostalgic, hostile -- this is music that, if you let it, will touch your life in ways beyond the TV and the PlayStation controller.
