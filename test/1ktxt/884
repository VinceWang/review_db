review/summary: Great testamony about God's love and power to heal
review/text: My friend told me about this book and asked me to read it. This is a great testamony about what God can do to help people in the low place. Doris story realy touched my heart and it woke me up about how many people are sexyualy abuesd and what terrible exspirience this is. We, I and my friend wanted to do something about it. We wanted more people to heare Doris story, so they would be able to get some help if this had happend to them, so we transleted her book from english into Icelandic. I have heard that it helped many people here in Iceland to get healing from God after they read this book.Arni
