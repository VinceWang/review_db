review/summary: Woo wee - I'm going to be rich now!
review/text: Anyone who buys lattes (plural) every day can understand ... it's just too expensive a habit! That's why I can't say enough about this product. It's great looking (I bought the Clear Bubbly one), super-simple to use, and most importantly, produced a beautiful, long-lasting foamy froth. (I use Simply Smart fat-free milk and am very pleased with the results.) Once you've got the foam you want, you can simply remove the metal screen mechanism and pop the jar in the microwave to warm the milk. Delicious!I have a crazy phobia about letting milk sit around for any length of time at room temperature, so if I'm going to use the Foamagic more than once during the day - and I typically do -- I rinse it well with water. I've put it in the dishwasher with good results, but think I'll be handwashing it as much as possible -- I'd hate to see the acrylic crack because of the temperature of my dishwasher.
