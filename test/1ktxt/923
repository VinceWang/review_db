review/summary: Not just for babies!
review/text: I teacher Kindergarten; and recently purchased this for my Kindergarten classroom. I have small group literacy activities for my kiddos to do in the morning, after they are finished (some may finish early), they have a variety of literacy and alphabet based independent activities they may choose. These blocks are a "special" privilege for those students who work hard during small group. These blocks are a favorite activity for my students! They can practice the beginning sounds of words and practice letter recognition. I highly recommend these for children 4-6 as well as babies and toddlers! I like the Ice Cream block, which has "sprinkles" to shake!
