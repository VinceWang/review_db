review/summary: Modern Traditional Point of View
review/text: The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures.
