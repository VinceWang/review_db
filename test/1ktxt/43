review/summary: AWESOME Game Soundtrack
review/text: I have several soundtracks from Japanese anime and very few from videogames. From the opening track to the 3 ending tracks this CD is terrific! It reworks some of the Chrono Trigger themes but the original music blows everything else away!I would buy it just for the opening theme and the &quot;best-end&quot; theme!If you haven't bought the Chrono Cross game yet, do yourself a favor and get them both at the same time!
