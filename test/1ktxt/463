review/summary: Fun but WAY too easy.
review/text: My 5.5 year old daughter solved this whole thing in around an hour or so. She had worked for weeks on the 12 Dancing Princesses game and we thought this would be similar. She liked it very much but I thought that it would be a project to last for several weeks but it definitely wasn't.
