review/summary: A Good Show, But I'm Kind of Annoyed. . .
review/text: I love this show, however, there are 14 episodes in the first season and this DVD only shows the first eight. This is kind of annoying as the best episodes happen towards the end of the season. I hope the BBC will release another DVD that contains all the episodes, but for now this one is still somewhat enjoyable.
