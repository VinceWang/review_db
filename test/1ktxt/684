review/summary: One of 2004's best commercial country albums
review/text: Of the flood of post-September 11 patriotic tunes, few have reached the lyrical heights of Alan Jackson's &quot;Where Were You,&quot; and in general most songs in the ouvre have been clumsy and ham-fisted, stuff like Toby Keith's oafish and embarrassingly bad &quot;Courtesy Of The Red, White &amp; Blue&quot; and &quot;American Soldier&quot; or Daryll Worley's catchy but poorly reasoned &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; songs that seek to persuade or score points in the ongoing cultural turf war back on the homefront. In contrast, this album's title track, Tony Lane and David Lee's &quot;Letters From Home,&quot; transcends the politics of the moment with an understated, emotionally resonant, well-crafted portrait of a soldier at war whose crushing daily regime is lightened by news from the folks back home. By not mentioning Saddam or Osama, the song retains a timelessness, speaking to the hardships and determination of soldiers in general, not just those send abroad in the Bush years, and its rise to the top of the charts is quite justly deserved. Though not as powerful as the single, the rest of the album is also pretty good -- on the very next track, Montgomery mentions seeing the war on the evening news, but lapses into escapism and the comfort of baby's arms. On the whole, though, singing one great song with such emotional power ain't bad, and fans who buy this album just on the strength of that track alone will not be disappointed by the rest of the disc.
