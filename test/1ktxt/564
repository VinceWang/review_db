review/summary: Very Not Worth Your Time
review/text: The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages.
