review/summary: &quot;Uh oh he's been using Brand X&quot;
review/text: An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real &quot;fusion&quot; types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?
