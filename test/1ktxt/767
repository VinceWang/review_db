review/summary: Brilliant game with short lifespan.
review/text: The original Outrun is a timeless classic. It's one of those video-games that will last forever and it came out of the golden era of wonderful arcade innovations, along with Double Dragon and Splatterhouse. Outrun was the first great racer, better than Pole Position on the Atari!!!There have been plenty of sequels and spin-offs to Outrun from the kinda okay Turbo Outrun to the just plain stupid Battle Outrun. None really had that extra spark which made the original so amazing. Outrun 2006 may not end up a classic but is still a brilliant game in it's own right.Rekindling that hedonistic, free-spirited, just-get-in-and-drive-anywhere feeling and sacrificing all the modern racing features for just sheer joyriding pleasure, Outrun 2006 is just such an easily accessible game for anyone.As usual it's filled with gorgeous scenery, brilliantly blue skies and amazing music. The classic 'Magical Sound Shower' (a great, great tune indeed) has been remixed but it also contains the 1986 mix for the purists.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that once you've finished it 5 times (such as I have already) there's not much point in going back to the same old courses. They could have included more.Ah well, it's still a game you should invest time and money in.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C+
