review/summary: Little Ball, for Little Dogs...
review/text: Great Toy, hard to find! We get ours online here or shipped from a friend in America!Our little Papillion-Yorkie mix loves it. Every night I am in the back garden kicking the ball for him! He destroys tennis balls by chewing off the fluff and our wee dog finds them to big to carry/catch. We stumbled across this in our local petstore and our dog was hooked! Sadly, local pet store no longer imports them.Stars all around for this one!
