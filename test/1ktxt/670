review/text: This cd is soooo cool. Especially the non-stop megamix the transitions are perfect, but you could be annoyed by the constant voice of the announcer. Some of what he says is very corny but you should be able to live with it (Especially when you're playing the actual game). All in all it's a great CD and a great buy.
