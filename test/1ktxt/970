review/summary: A truly great resource
review/text: I bought this book a few weeks ago from the Pen American Center. I've found over 100 sources of funding that I qualify for right now and about 50 more that I qualify for later. I am really loving this book. It is designed in such a way that it's easy to scan all listings for ones that apply to you and easy to search for specific ones as well. In the back everything is indexed several ways, making things even easier to find.The information they provide you with is comprehensive and extensive. Kudos to the editor and researcher!If you're a writer, be it fiction, plays, journalistic, non-fiction, whatever, this book is a great resource for you.
