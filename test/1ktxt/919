review/text: Highly recommended. My 16mo daughter has these alphabet blocks plus many of the additional peek-a-block sets. She loves to take each block out of the bin, examine it, and get the next one. This can go on for 20+ minutes, which is hours in toddler land. She has enjoyed playing with them since she was about 9 months old. Each block is so unique and interactive that the set easily captures her interest. We also have the IncrediBlock and other compatible Fisher Price toys. Like any other blocks, they're great for stacking and knocking down. We recently had several parents of similarly aged kids visit our house and they all thought this was a great toy. I love playing with them, too!
