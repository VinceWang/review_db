review/summary: You've got to hand it to the author...
review/text: I purchased this book after reading rave reviews of it included within a review of a really good book I'd read. Apparently, the author (or her friends and family) are placing reviews of good books and encouraging people to buy this book if you liked the one they were reviewing. Great marketing by the author. However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler. It is a self-published, self-edited (and extremely poorly edited, I might add), and self-promoted lame excuse for a novel. My eyes rolled constantly while reading this book. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did. The best part of this book is the short length. There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon. I really feel duped for purchasing this book after reading about it in Amazon's readers' reviews. Don't waste your money. The author should have printed only enough copies for family and friends. The rest of the population should be spared having to read this drivel.
