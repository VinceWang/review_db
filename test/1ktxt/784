review/summary: 35 years and still around!
review/text: I was given my Henry dog when i was 1 year old in 1973.35 years later he still sits in the bedroom, where my children are amazed Daddy still has his soft toy.I have bought one of the new Henry dogs for my 6 year old daughter as she always loved my old Henry, and the comfort he gave me through my child hood. A classic toy worth lots of hugs.
