review/summary: The Guide to Owning a Birman Cat (The Guide to Owning)
review/text: Wonderful! Karen Cummings writes a book that tells you all the basics in cat care and tailors it to the Birman breed. The excellent photographs enable the reader to see what a Birmans really looks like. The history of the Birman, (Sacred cat of Burma), it's mythic legend is beautifully illustrated in the artworks that appear on page three and on seven, &quot;Mandela Cat&quot; and &quot;Temple of the Sacred Cat&quot;. I am the artist of these artworks and I am very impressed with the excellent reproductions produced by the publisher. In addition, as a Birman, breeders for over 15 years I can and do highly recommend this book.
