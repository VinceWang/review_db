review/summary: 80's High Tech with Rock Emotion
review/text: Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&amp;M projects. The song &quot;Curious Kind&quot; is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!
