review/summary: GREAT GIFT FOR ANY TRADITIONAL ARCHER
review/text: I received my book on a friday and read it cover to cover in two days. I loved it. Howard Hill was not only the greatest archer in the world, but an excellent story teller. He does everything from shooting a buffalo while riding a horse, to bowfishing under water and shooting a large shark. He even has a technical chapter on bowmaking, and his style of shooting. Any archer will enjoy reading this book.
