review/text: I would definitely recommend buying this CD. My 5 year old loved it. It is visually breathtaking and will engage young ones for hours. The only drawback is that you only get to redecorate the castle. There is no variation to the tasks so that once you've completed the castle, if you want to play again, you do exactly what you had done before but there is a great deal of variety and combinations for decorating the castle. It is like a very sophisticated coloring book.
