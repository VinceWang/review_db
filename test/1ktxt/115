review/summary: Vagrant Story Music is as good as the game
review/text: This soundtrack is amazing. Simply Amazing. Hitoshi Sakimoto has done an excellent job with this soundtrack. Every song is great in its own accord. If you listen to this soundtrack and u havent played the game you will want to play it immediately. From th beautiful ending theme to the amazing boss themes, you will love every minute of it. An extraordinary soundtrack to accompany an extraordinary game. Square music at its best.
