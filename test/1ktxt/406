review/summary: A classic
review/text: Required reading for anyone interested in the apologists. It is also an early contribution to the study of ethnicity, culture, and identity in late antiquity -- hot topics as of late. Highlights include references to obscure German authors and meticulous readings of the source texts (not to mention the fascinating chapters on Justin and Celsus).
