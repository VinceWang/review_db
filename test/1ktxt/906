review/summary: Love these modern ABC blocks with the little objects inside for extra interest
review/text: I do love these blocks that I bought for my 13 month old grandson for Christmas but later found out that this particular group of peek a blocks doesn't interact with the big cube that my daughter bought for Christmas. It came with its own group of 8 blocks that do interact with the cube but there are other peek a block groups such as the vehicles, jungle animals, farm animals, ABCs. It would have been nice, really rather, e xpected that the ABC blocks especially would have been interactive with the main system and would have announced the name of the letter when that block was affixed onto the activation port, but they don't. I think there may be music played , but that's all. Only the 8 blocks that came with the large cube system are programmed into it.
