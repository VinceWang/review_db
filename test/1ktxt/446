review/text: I have always encouraged outdoor exercise instead of the computer, however I don't mind my 5 year old daughter playing with this game. It teaches them creativity, puzzle solving, logic and listening comprehension. Barbie gives them hints if they come to an impasse and presents a certificate with their name on it when they navigate through a maze, which is a great tool for self-esteem, confidence and accomplishment.The graphics and sound are superb,and it will not intimidate first time users. I highly recommend this CD-Rom for ages 4 and up-it is worth the price paid. Lisa Horne
