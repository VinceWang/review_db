review/text: Of all the AEC recordings, I think that this recording best defines who the AEC is.It generally is more raw than their ECM recordings, and this has the best balance between improvistation and composition. You have the otherworldly Illistrum, the raw but ritualistic title track, the R&amp;B tinged Scuffle Shuffle, and a few vibrant non-Western styles in What's to Say. Nonaah is how Stockhausen would have sounded if he had hung out in the South Side of Chicago.This effort has a get-down-to-business approach which leaves virtually no dead spots on this project.This recording gets the highest of possible ratings.
