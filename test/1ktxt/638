review/summary: Gobblet fun
review/text: Last Christmas, I bought the Gobblet Jr. for my grandsons, who were 4 and 6. They both had fun playing, and I was impressed with the extra level of strategy necessary because of the gobbling ability of the pieces. Only trouble was that my older grandson easily beat me.
