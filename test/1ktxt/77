review/text: This volume in the Naxos Complete Guitar Music of Fernando Sor is one of the best.The artisty of John Holmquist is reflected in the superb soundof the guitar, which is nearly in your listening room. Th music is simple, uncomplicated and enchanting. That Sor lived before Mozart was born, andafter Mozart died, is fascinating and reflected in his innovative music, original and compelling. A must have disc.
