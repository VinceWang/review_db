review/summary: Book is great - Purchase misleading !
review/text: I have no quarrel with the book itself. Wanted a copy for a long time. However, I purchased a used book with the understanding that it was a "Signed Copy." The copy I received WAS NOT autographed. This is a disappointment. If you advertise it as an autographed copy, don't substitute one that isn't. Leaves me in serious doubt regarding furture purchases. I'd appreciate some clarification. Regards, Elmer Kurrus
