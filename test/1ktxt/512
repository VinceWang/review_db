review/summary: Hamelin does it again
review/text: I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him. The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites. Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support. This is a "must have" CD for anyone who loves great piano playing. The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too.
