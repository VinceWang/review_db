review/text: I have never cared to much for video game music before. Basically,I just cared about the fun factor and storyline. But when I put Chrono Cross into my Playstation for the first time I was blown away by the opening FMV with the score &quot;Time's Scar&quot;. After that I payed real close attention to the music throughout the entire game. I was simply impressed with how the music swept me right into the game. It put me in a different state of mind. Relieved all my stress and let me relax. It scared me when it brought a tear to my eye. Never would I have thought that video game music would do this to me. And no, Im not exaggerating. And I highly reccomend this incredible soundtrack and the rest of Mitsuda's work (Chrono Trigger, Xenogears)to anyone with a taste for beautiful music!
