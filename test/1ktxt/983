review/text: Hearing straight from the whales.. who knew!!How refreshing to hear the whales speak through Mary Getten. This book is informative, funny, insightful and filled with the kind of respect all the sentient beings deserve. Her book is a glimpse of how well Mary "listens"not only to the cetaceans but all her animal clients. It's heartfelt and honest.Mary's encounters had me steeped in the experience.. It was as if I was right there.I could feel the whales on every page and it made me cry.If you love whales this will take you straight into their world!!! What a great ride!!Thank God people are finally waking up to the truth about communicating with animals..It's about time.. they have so much to teach us.. certainly we can't be that arrogant!!!
