review/summary: My Henry
review/text: I had Henry back in the 70's. I don't remember him with a nose since it was chewed off, but he was well loved. He's long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about. I can't believe I've found him again!! Nobody can replace my original worn Henry, but I'm so excited to have his clone back!!
