review/text: i can't argue with any of these reviews, they are all on point. It's amazing to me how Big Pokey can come out with a cd that is so good and underground, while at the same time you got so many mainstream rappers selling millions of cd's that are sub-par. I see theres sellers on here practically giving this cd away for 5 bucks, go ahead and cop this.
