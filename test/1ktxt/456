review/summary: Great fun for kids!
review/text: My review is targeted toward those that wish this game for their toddler age kids. I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter. She is a huge fan of the Barbie animated movies and Rapunzel is one of her favorites. This game is so much fun for her! It definately keeps her attention span for long periods of time...which is saying something for a toddler! The game is easy for her to use. This is a good thing because she is very stubborn and independant...she does not like mommy and daddy helping her. Basically, the evil Gothel has cast a spell over the castle and turned the Prince into stone. To win, you must complete each level (which is just transforming it from dark and gloomy into bright and cheery) and then travel through a maze to rescue the Prince. To transform each room, the player gets to pick out paint colors, decorate different accessories in the room, etc. There are plenty of different options for each room to keep the little ones happy! I could defintely see how this would be entertaining for kids of different ages...perfect for siblings with a few years in age difference. I have recently purchased the 12 Dancing Princesses game and it is not anywhere near being as good or entertaining as this one!
