review/summary: Even for a non-player, this CD is excellent
review/text: Chrono Cross is a landmark game for the Playstation in the fact that it is the very last game ever to be produced in the US for the system. While the graphics are stunning, the music.. oh the music! The music is what led me to buy this!While the insert notes are illegable for those who are illeterate in the Japanese language, it contains the listing of songs... which I myself can't completely read an need someone to translate them over!The best songs are on Disk Three... the Burning of Lucca's Orphanage, The Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers are by far the shining stars of this whole CD set.
