review/summary: Very promising d&eacute;but solo album
review/text: With this 2005 d&eacute;but solo album, "Neptunes", 35-year old Jerome Froese has finally severed the reins and moved away from the familial music-making of Tangerine Dream to strike out on his own. And a very impressive affair it is, too, boding well for the future of his "Guitartronica" project -- blending guitar and MIDI synthesisers and sequencers -- of which this is the first release. Although there remain traces of his TD up-bringing, particularly in the use of wordless female vocal samples and the occasional orchestral string wash, the music here offers both a heavier base and wider range of styles, textures and moods than has been evident in the output of his father's band for a good many years. Jerome's guitar-playing is more versatile and more assured, and his sense of beat finitely more secure than those of Edgar; these combine to make this a very mature album indeed.The whole production (78 minutes spread over 12 tracks) is heavily guitar- and drum-focused and very readily drops into a dance beat but is nevertheless rich and varied in texture and also offers a pleasing shift of mood and in atmosphere as it progresses. It provides many rewards for those who prefer to listen to their music rather than simply to feel (or to move to) it and this album should appeal both to a modern audience as well as to an older generation still bemoaning the disappearance of the 1980s' Tangerine Dream sound world.Highly recommended to anyone looking for something new. (And if you're looking for more like this, try the 2007 follow-up album, "Shiver Me Timbers".)
