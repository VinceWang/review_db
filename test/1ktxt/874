review/summary: Masterful interpretations
review/text: Of many CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years, this easily ranks as one of the best. Kudos to Muse for finally recording Spaulding as a leader in 1988 and now to Joel Dorn for reissuing the disk.As the title indicates, &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; is filled with music by Monk. But what stands out is the freshness of the interpretations of the master's pieces. Rather than simply trying to sound like Monk, Spaulding and his cohorts try -- very successfully -- to make music that builds on Monk's ideas.Spaulding tears through every solo he has on alto, and offers beautiful contrast with his flute playing, as on &quot;Let's Cool One.&quot; He's aided by trumpeter Wallace Roney, who abandons his occasional propensity for imitating Miles Davis and instead lets his own sound shine through. Pianist Mulgrew Miller has never sounded better. In fact, the whole group (Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums) strongly delivers the message that they are playing music that they love. There is no better way to express that love than by offering the robust voicings that you hear on this disk.If there is a regret when you listen to this music it is that Spaulding, who contributed so much to Blue Note dates in the '60s, has had so few opportunities to further explore his own muse. Better late than never.
