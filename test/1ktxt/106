review/summary: Whispers of the Wicked Saints
review/text: I really enjoyed this book, sure this author is just starting out, but I still really liked it. How many books have the reviewers that hated this book wrote and got published? I read a lot, and I always have. I don't usually like modern love stories, but I gave it a chance and found that I didn't want to put it down until I finished it. I look forward to reading her next book and no I'm not a family member or a friend. Just give her book a chance and you might just find that it really is pretty good.
