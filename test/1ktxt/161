review/summary: ORBISON'S MUSICAL TIME MACHINE
review/text: Roy Orbison was one of those rare vocalists whose live performance could equal and indeed surpass his recorded work.So it is with this superb collection of recordings from various concert performances.There is,of necessity,repetition of the tracks.Orbison fans came to hear the great songs and Roy gave them what they came for.Few artists could sustain a whole show with nothing but their own self-composed million-sellers like the Big 'O'.Listening to these recordings transports me back to the magic of a Roy Orbison concert.Hear the beautiful sweeping power of his voice,the death-defying leaps on the highest notes,the poetry of his lyrics.From disc to disc their are subtle nuances,little changes in emphasis,inflexion and tone.Throughout there is sheer brilliance of the highest order.
