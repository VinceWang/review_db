review/text: I really enjoyed the book. I believe the author did a good job at tackeling the subject of poor conduct in the church. I was reminded that we are all human, and even the mighty shall fall. Now I have to speak my mind regarding the poor reviews. I was shocked at the bahavior of "adults" What happened to respect for others. In my opinion I have to say those who wrote the mean reviews are nothing short of ignorent and without a doubt low class. Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book? Obviously not many because you all have way too much time on your hands. I liked the book, and remember that those of you in glass houses should not throw stones.
