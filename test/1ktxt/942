review/summary: Good product, BUT make sure you check that all the letters are there before giving them as a gift!
review/text: I bought these blocks for my daughter as a birthday gift and when I received them in the mail there were two "V" blocks and the "T" block was missing. These blocks are so cool, but you might want to make sure the alphabet is correct before wrapping it up as a gift for a child. However, they are the neatest blocks I've ever seen, so it was definitely worth sending them back for a different one.
