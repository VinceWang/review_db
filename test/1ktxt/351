review/summary: Very good synopsis of Europe
review/text: I love the pictures in this book and brief history of each country/culture at the beginning of each chapter. It is a great overview of European sites and helps us decide what's most important for us to visit! I'm enjoying it very much. It's not like a Rick Steves book, with in-depth reviews of each area, but it's a great overall review for people like us who haven't been to Europe yet and are trying to decide what we would like to see. Rick's books are excellent for more in-depth visits, but this is great for first-timers trying to figure it all out.
