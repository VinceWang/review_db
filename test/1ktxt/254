review/text: I am currently researching the hotel industry when I stumbled upon this series. I immediately took a chance and was more than satisfied to know that my gut instinct was right. The coolest thing about this series is that it is something that my fiance and I are heavily addicted to. The drama is quite intense and very entertaining. The one thing that kind of irked me was that Charlie was not as tough or outspoken as I would have liked. He was great with the guests but in regards to the staff and his boss he was a bit too reserved for me. I highly recommend this series and can't wait to see what happens in Season 2
