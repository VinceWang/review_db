review/summary: May be the best toy that we've bought
review/text: These are clever, cute, colorful, and fun for even mom and dad. He plays with them every day, each one with a different shape, sounds, activity... They were the perfect size for 6-9 mos hands as he learned to grasp, and as he's gotten older, he's more captivated by what's inside or what they do. We just bought more for his first birthday to add to the alphabet set, and I expect that we'll collect additional sets in the next year via auction sites. Just a super buy that I'm glad that we found for our son.
