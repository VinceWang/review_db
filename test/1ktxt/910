review/summary: Wonderful gift for my daughters!
review/text: My daughters, ages 3, 2 and 11 months old were given this block set for Christmas and they ALL love it! My three year old loves to find the different letters she's learned. My two year old loves to make towers and knock them over. My 11 month old loves them just as much as the other two do! Each block is different and each is so much fun! My husband and I love to play with the blocks too! We have several of the toys that these blocks can go with, so this set is just perfect! I'm looking forward to teaching my girls more of their letters using these blocks!
