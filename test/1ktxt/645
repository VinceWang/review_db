review/summary: I was voted "favorite aunt" by my 3-year-old niece!
review/text: Apparently this is about the best $... I have spent lately (aside from the Gameboy game I sent my nephew). My niece is mesmorized by this game, and it is keeping my sister busy building parades. My niece is a little too young to run this program by herself, but she has definitely figured out what button needs to be pushed to make the parade start! My sister also told me that she likes the fact that you can save multiple parades for those days when she just doesn't have time to help create a new one. This seems to be a winner!
