review/summary: The Best Sourdough Starter for Bread & Hot Cakes
review/text: I had an excellent sourdough starter from a friend in Alaska. Debbie lived on the 49 Mile River. During the winter they, Debbie & Brad made bent wood furinture to sell in a general store in Dawson. Then pan for gold in the summer. Sourdough bread & hot cakes was a staple of life for them living in such a remote location.Ruth Allman's, "Alaska Sourdough" cook book is an excellent primer in making a sourdough "starter" from scratch,(just in case you can't get a start from a friend) the proper care for your starter, and how to rejuveniate the starter when needed. We are very selective who we share our sourdough bread & rolls with. We don't want to be depended upon to provide bakery items all the time.We made our purchase from redtree15 on Amazon Marketplace. We really appreciate the service provided.
