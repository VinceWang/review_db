review/summary: Jerome Froese - Neptunes
review/text: This album took a few months to track down on CD but the wait was worth it. I echo the sentiments of the other reviewers here in that this album by Jerome far surpasses in quality and originality any recent Tangerine Dream releases.The album is composed of 12 impressive sonic soundscapes (though the last hardly counts as only 40 seconds long). All the tracks have a freshness and lush atmosphere that is quite appealing. its one of those albums that you listen to in entirety rather than selecting a few tracks.
