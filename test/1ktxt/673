review/text: The songs on DISC 1 are not the full versions, they are the game versions of the songs.You get the whole soundtrack here, PLUS you get hits from 2nd mix as well.Disc 2 is a remix of all the tracks, and they are mixed beautifully. You can put Disc 2 in and have a dance party. They really spent a lot of time mixing the songs. Also, on Disc 2 some songs are longer than the version in the arcade, so you get to hear more of certain songs.I highly recommend this CD to any DDR fan.
