review/summary: Can you believe?
review/text: This book contains some 25 chapters of a woman and a female Orca communicating telepathically. It changed my entire perspective on animal intelligence, and opened me to greater human possibilities that I had been denying but now know are possible.So dont listen to the nay-sayers. Pick up this book and decide for yourself what you really think about this phenomenon.George Denniston MD
