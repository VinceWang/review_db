review/summary: A darn good take-off on the 10-times-as-much models
review/text: We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty, perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model, but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an "original" solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up, it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up), and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT
