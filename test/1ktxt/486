review/summary: A Blast From My Past
review/text: I once purchased a 12" of Jesse Rae's song RUSHA. I really enjoyed it and thought it might be nice to have an overview of his work. It's funny how you can remember somthing fondly only to hear it later in life and think...it's okay. Sorry, but the same is true for this recording, a bit dated, a bit tiresome, but fun.
