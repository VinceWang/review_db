review/summary: Witty and worthy production
review/text: A crisp production negotiated with wit and flair, this delicious confection offers a tantilizing glimpse of the mores and manners of Sheridan's 18th century England. Guided with a sure hand by Michael Langham and Nick Havinga, this handsome production is well paced, wittily acted, and far worthier than the sneering commentary of the reviewers below would have you believe.
