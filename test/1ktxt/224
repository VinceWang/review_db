review/summary: Very Happy - Has "Random" capability for MP3s
review/text: I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select "random" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality.
