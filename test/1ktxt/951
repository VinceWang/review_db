review/summary: Never Too Old
review/text: After "eyeing" this toy for several months and being hesitant to buy it because of the cost, we finally broke bown and purchased it when our daughter was 15 months old. We're very glad we did!Our daughter loves shaking the blocks, banging them together and knocking over the blocks after we stack them up for her. She really likes putting them all into a plastic bin and then taking them all out again! The letter written on each block is meaningless to her right now, but that time will come.We plan to keep these blocks for a few years. As our daughter approaches school age, the blocks will be a great tool to help teach and reinforce letter-sound association. We believe she may never be too old to benefit from her Peek-A-Boo blocks. We know we're not!Consider donating your set to a local library or school when you're done with them.
