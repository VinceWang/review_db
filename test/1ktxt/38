review/summary: Best Video Game Score Ever
review/text: Mitsuda is a musical genius. All the parts he writes seem to fall into place perfectly. I grew up loving music by John Williams and Hans Zimmer and this guy is right up there with them. For some songs his style turns away from the traditonal orchestra and still has the same impact. One of the best parts is only a few songs seem ambient while the others are just amazing. My favorites are, Lost Pieces, Garden of God, On the Banks of a Dream, and possibly the one of the saddest themes I've ever heard is People Seized With Life. First time listeners would probably think this music was from some epic movie when in fact it's the music to an epic game. The Chrono series has two of the best rpg's ever and by far the best composer writing for them.
