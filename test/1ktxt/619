review/summary: Good Deep Beatdown Sound Classic
review/text: I'm not gonna do a long drawn out review. Its a really good cd that has some extreamly moody and beautiful tracks such as "Let Me In", "Just One Minute" and "Enchanted. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of 5 is because some of the songs are a bit similar. But over all this is a quality cd worth owning. It has that modern classic beatdown sound that I love.
