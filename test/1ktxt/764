review/summary: Jaquith History
review/text: Amazing to learn that every Jaquith that you have ever met has descended from a single ancestor (Abraham Jaquith) who emigrated to the US in the 1600's as a Huggenot. Numerous Jaquith ancestors were patriots who fought and died for this country from the King Philip's War on. The only reason I did not give this family biography a 5 star rating is because some of the historical data in the living members of the Jaquith family is not correct. The older the records, the more correct the data is.
