review/summary: Fun selection of blocks! Great alternative to the traditional alphabet blocks
review/text: I love the Peek-a-blocks sets that are out there and I was excited to see the alphabet set available. Every child should have a set of alphabet blocks and these are so much more fun than the basic wood ones. A few people have said that the letter obstructs what is inside, but I don't really agree. While they do have the letter on the one side, you get three other sides to view the inside object just fine. And isn't the point of the alphabet block the letter anyway? It is nice that it comes in a reusable case with a handle too. Just make sure and do your research before you bought. I did some digging around online and got this set for only $25!
