review/summary: Communicating With Orcas - The Whales Perspective
review/text: I found this book amazing. I'm from Michigan and we "Michiganders" tend to think about lakes not oceans. This book opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about the world. It also made me start to think about the oceans creatures in more than just a "far away" way. If you do believe in animal communiation you will find this book to be a wonderfully different type of perspective. If you think animal communication is a "bunch of nonsense" this book may seem really strange to you, but it also makes you start to think "What if the whales do think, What if other animals think, what would they think of us and our running, running rather than enjoying and loving life" I highly recommend this book to all!!
