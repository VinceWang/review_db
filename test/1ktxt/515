review/summary: Great Learning Game for Varying Levels of Ability
review/text: My son enjoys this game very much. It requires you to find objects that match specific shapes and numerals, and it offers beginning addition and subtraction as well. Children know they've got the right answer when the puzzle pieces match up, which is really fun. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the subtraction part of the game has the potential to be confusing. For example, on one puzzle piece it shows three apples with a number 3 below it, a minus sign, and then one apple with a number 1 below it. While you and I know that three minus one is 2, when I presented this to my son, he covered the one apple that was after the minus sign, looked at the initial three apples, and said "three." If your child has a problem with this as well, I recommend using real food or household objects (e.g. apples, markers, spoons, crayons) to teach subtraction. Then, when you present three objects and ask your child how many there are when they take away one, they can clearly see there are only two left.
