review/summary: The best little known singer in this genre
review/text: I bought this and another Gloria Lynne cd after a friend gave me No Detour, which I like marginally better.It is one thing to rave about the voice - and hers is not surpassed by anyone else - but her selection of material is outstanding.Right up there almost with Nina Simone to my taste.
