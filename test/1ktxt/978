review/summary: Makes for fascinating reading.
review/text: Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch
