review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda pushed the PlayStation to the limits with one of the most lush soundtracks to ever grace a game. Perfectly keyed to its settings, the music drips with the feeling of tropical islands and exotic locales before dipping into the darker requiems near the end.It's hard to believe this is synthesizer work, as it's some of the clearest and most rich sound to come out of a game. It fits the atmosphere and settings perfectly. It's especially powerful once you've played through the game, as the emotional impact of certain scenes (like the fight against Miguel in the Tower of Geddon) is enhanced beyond words by tracks like &quot;People Imprisoned by Destiny&quot; (disc 2, track 16). Other music - like &quot;Voyage - Home World&quot; (disc 2, track 05) and &quot;Dancing Lizards&quot; (disc 1, track 05) are just perfect for opening the window and feeling good. Mitsuda's skillful mix of dark, operatic, and brooding tunes with bouncy, bright tropicalia makes for an excellent album.This is one of a few game music soundtracks I would fully recommend to everyone, even those who aren't into the genre - or don't play games. It's amazing and should not be missed. And, of course, if you ARE a fan of game music, and don't own this... I'm amazed. Buy it as soon as possible, it is not a regrettable decision.
