review/summary: Hardest Pit in the South
review/text: Big Pokey is one of the best rappers out of the South. No one can do it like him. This album is a small example of what he can do on the mic. Need more proof, listen to the old Screw tapes. You must have this cd in your collection and be on the look out for that new Big Pokey coming soon!!!
