review/summary: great teaching tool but not a great game
review/text: This is a good pure strategy game but it has one defect that limits it for older players. The Original Gobblet is 4x4 and is a fun complex sophisticated strategy game, but it's also a long game not suited to 6 year olds just getting started in board games. Gobblet Junior looked like great idea when I bought it. 3x3 meant games would end quickly but teach the basic stategy. Perfect for a 6 year old.The problem is that the person who goes first can force the win. This force is not perfectly simple as it not a pre-determined set of moves but is rather like a predetermined set of responses. So if you can memorize chess openings or checker openings then you can always win this game.The good news is that until the child comes to realize this and seek tat solution it is a good game a teaching how to think several moves ahead. it is fun. But eventually one realizes it is a won game and a lot of the fascination is lost. So it's good training for many month, then you need to buy a 4x4.
