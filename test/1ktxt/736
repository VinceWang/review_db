review/summary: Has not dropped off my favorites list in 18 years
review/text: This is inspired playing, with life and enthusiasm lifting memorable melodies. Donald Brown has a remarkable melodic sense and is one of the best at "comping" behind a soloist. This record is one of the most played in my collection over the last 18 years or so. The solos are intense, but never combative with the joyous spirit of the melodies and catchy hooks in the tunes.
