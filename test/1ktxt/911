review/summary: A must have for little ones everywhere!
review/text: My little boy received these as a present on his 1st Birthday. I was a bit worried he would find these boring as he is a very picky boy when it comes to toys.To make this short and sweet, he LOVES these so much!!!I can't imagine not having them now. He adores when I stack them up for him and he knocks them down. He spends a lot of time just shaking them, studying them and handing them to me so I can look at them. He is very proud of his blocks and sometimes throws them on to the wood floor to get my attention. This said, thy are super durable and after much abuse have lived to tell the tale without cracks or coming apart.He also enjoys using these with other toys and will store them in the container type toys.The little objects inside are very cute and some of them move if you turn the little hole on the bottom. (My little one hasn't learned how to do this yet.) The birds make a squeak noise when you push in the bottom and the train is my favorite as it goes round & in a tunnel. A lot of thought were put in these and it shows.An all around wonderful toy!
