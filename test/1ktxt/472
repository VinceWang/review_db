review/summary: Not so good - ok for a rental!
review/text: This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one "castle" for the kids to "decorate" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the "castle" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.
