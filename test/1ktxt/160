review/summary: Better than I thought.
review/text: I wrote a harsh review based on hearing a couple of tracks from one album,but after hearing tracks from the other 3 albums,I have to say that I take it back and in fact I bought it.The other albums are very good value for money with good liner notes and some very good music.Well worth the money for Roy Orbison fans.
