review/summary: Fun math!
review/text: My daughter received this for her third birthday. She was able to do level 1 (shapes) and level 2 (counting) pretty independently, if I separated the left and right side pieces from each other and told her she needed to pick one from each side. Having the bus to "frame" her pieces was helpful. I love that they put the number words under the numbers. After she found the match for six, she said "S-I-X makes six!" and was very proud of herself. We started doing level three, but only the addition, and she was fine with it. I can see what a previous reviewer said about subtraction being a problem by covering the second number with the picture, though. But so far, she's enjoying her success, enjoying putting the pieces together, and feeling very smart indeed. The pieces are made of strong cardboard, which should be durable enough to last until she is no longer interested. I think this might be too easy for a five or six year old, though, and the recommended age is up to age 6.
