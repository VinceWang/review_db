review/summary: Unbelievable music!
review/text: I heard "Troya" on Sirius/XM's Chill station, and set about finding the music. "Dreaming Of" appears not to be available in MP3 (or I just missed it). If you have to buy it on CD, wait for a reasonable price here, or find it somewhere else online. Having heard the entire disc, I would have paid a lot more than I did. Still, the reseller prices I see as of this writing are a bit steep. I paid $18.50 including shipping -- a normal price for a title outside the mainstream. Worth every penny.
