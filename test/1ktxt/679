review/summary: MORE THAN LETTERS...
review/text: I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN
