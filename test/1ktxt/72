review/summary: Small Churches CAN Have Wonderful Worship
review/text: Many small churches feel like they can not have great worship because they lack the resources that larger churches take for granted.Ray's list of "thou shalts" is worth the price of the book.The description of various "personalities" in the small church is both humorous, and so true.This book gives encouragement as well as practical advice.
