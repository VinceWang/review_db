review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this charger was so small. The others that I looked at were larger. I also appreciate the fact that this one doesn't have a long cord that has to be curled up when I'm not using it. It takes up much less room in the camera bag. Another plus is that the plug folds under when not in use. That makes the unit even more compact and the plug is less likely to scratch something when stored away.
