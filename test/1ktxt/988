review/summary: The best video workout I've ever exercised with!
review/text: The combination of spot-toning , weight-training, step-aerobics and circuit-training make this the most enjoyable tape I've ever exercised with. If you find aerobics tapes boring, this is the workout to do. The exercise changes during the course of the workout definitely keep this tape from becoming a mundane routine. Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
