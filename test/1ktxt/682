review/summary: back on good ground
review/text: Great album. very good "story" songs. obviously, the title track is the stand out, but there are a few others that are worthy of praise too. "good ground" is an up tempo number that should be a hit. "look at me now" is a ballad that will likely be a favorite of everybody. "goes good with beer" is the type of song that will be a well known sing along if it gets released to radio. "that changes everything" is another mid tempo tune that is very enjoyable. i didn't find any filler songs on the entire cd. it's a must buy for anybody.. not just jmm fans.
