review/text: This soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. It contains all of the songs heard in the game. They are mostly played in chronological order. This music is all orchestral and follows a caribbian theme, since the game is based around a group of islands. Most of the songs and the booklet it comes with are all in Japanese. The only things that are in English are a few of the really important song titles. This music is well worth getting even though the price may be a little high. But think about it you are getting 67 songs spread over 3 CD's. Anyway I would highly suggest this music to any Chrono Cross Game fanatic, or if you enjoy orchestral music.Hope this review helps.
