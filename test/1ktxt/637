review/summary: Great Game!
review/text: This game seems so simple yet it can be very complex. It is easy and quick to learn. The adults had as much fun as the younger kids! It is a durable game made of wood. It is so durable in fact that we will be taking this camping with us for hours of fun! Initially we thought this was sort of pricey, but it has been worth every cent we paid. It is a quality made strategy game. We can't wait to get the bigger version for the big kids!
