review/summary: Easy Set Up
review/text: Love this machine! Works great! Set up was easy, although I probably made it harder than it needed to be.I spent some time trying to understand the manual. I finallly just went for it and found setting up the machine was easy.I connected the cable to the dvd player, the color coded cords from the DVD player to the TV &amp; TADA! I was done.I was able to view a VHS tape immediately or switch to a DVD. What's nice about this machine is that I don't have to got through a lot of gyrations to view a DVD or VHS tape. The Sanyo I used to have required all kinds of set up just to view a DVD. (The moon had to be in Aquarious in the seven house and the planets had to be in alignment, just kidding). But seriously, I had to write down the steps for the Sanyo just to remember how to use it. Don't think you'll have that problem with this machine. A happy customer.
