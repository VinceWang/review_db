review/text: I haven't read this book, but dont stop reading just yet. To all of you who have been living in ignorance for the past few years, I'd like to open ur eyes to a little magazine known as SLAM. 3 words: OF THA HOOK (please excuse my language - just trying to talk the talk)But seriously, no matter how die-hard of a ball fan you are, this is essential reading. Ryan Jones writes for the mag.
