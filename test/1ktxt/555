review/summary: Made me take a new look at my life -- and change it.
review/text: This little book is one of the most important works I have read in my 50+ years. With simple, yet incredibly powerful ideas, it challenged me to get &quot;out of my philosophical box&quot; and think again about life, God, and how it all works together. Recalling the simple statement Jesus made, that we &quot;must become like little children...&quot;, I played along with the exercises outlined in the book and found an earth-shaking change taking place in my life. Read this without judgment or prejudice -- and see for yourself!
