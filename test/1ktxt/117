review/summary: Great jacket for the money
review/text: This jacket met every expectation and more. Although heavy, it is comfortable and can be snugged down for a more "tailored" fit. If anything could be a "con" its the zippers...when the linings are out, there are a lot of zippers exposed and I often try to zip the wrong ones! The liners are great....keep you dry, keep off the wind, or keep you warm. I have no complaints. The jacket may be short for some people...but I'm very short-waisted and it fits me perfect. I sized up 1 size and it is quite comfortable.
