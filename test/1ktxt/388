review/summary: The Best Archery Book I've Ever Read!
review/text: Hunting the Hard Way is the best book I have ever read. This book is about the adventures of Howard Hill and others that accompanied him on his hunting trips. Howard Hill used a laminated bamboo longbow that he made in his archery shop. He was an excellent shot with the bow also. He took some amazing shots at animals in this book. The most amazing shot in my opinion was at an elk at over 150 yards! He also went hunting with his bow and arrow.
