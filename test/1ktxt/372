review/summary: If it's Tuesday it must be Belgium
review/text: This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a &quot;buffet&quot; tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...).
