review/summary: A great comeback effort
review/text: This was Red's comeback album after being off the jazz scene for over a dozen years, thanks mainly to a severe drug addiction, though other health problems contributed (bad teeth and a stroke in 1972). His chops were not back yet and he knew it, and it shows to a certain extent on this CD. But there is also some great stuff here.For one thing he is not afraid to be ambitious and except for his frequent employment of the mute (which I think he uses to hide the fact that his open tone, which later became as ringing and bell-like as it had been in the '50s, wasn't back yet), he is on the attack. Tempos are up and his playing fiery. This is especially true on DONNA LEE and 52nd STREET THEME, classic bop tunes that demand precision and energy. Alto sax man Charles McPherson is a good foil for Red and plays well throughout. The rhythm section is solid and probably the steadiest player on the date is pianist Barry Harris: he is the perfect anchor for the date. Considering the circumstances, especially the effects from the stroke the year before, Red overcomes the adversity and had every right to be proud of this album. Hopefully, he was.
