review/summary: Good player but wish I could change a few things
review/text: Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up. However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds. Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback. Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds. Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape. This stuff may seem trivial. Anyway, that's my two cents.
