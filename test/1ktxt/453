review/summary: Barbie Rupenzel CD - Good but annoying parts
review/text: I'm StoryMaker. Me, Russian Blue Witch, and Chocolate Dog borrowed it from a friend who has lots of computer games and I'm jeolus. Anyways, I'm a good artist. I love art. Only I can find this a little bad. Something that really really really really annoys me is you can only fit 12 names on the sign-in list! That is NOT average, I read you can fit 99 names on other games. And since this is like other games and you need to start a new user for a new game after me and RBW and C-Dog played it a few times whenever we tried to type a name in the box it gave us an error message that said that the list is full and you press Ctrl and D to delete a name or something and I counted the users...there are 12. And it is hard to choose what things to use and I like the things where you don't choose from things and it annoys me in those things you can't get out of the lines even though you're using a P-brush. Espeaking of p-brushes the p-brush in the 'choose' thing it is annoying because you can't to half-n-half! And after you do something, you can't change it and when you're done and go to the maskarade ball there ussaly is no mask! What I mean is Barbie is not holding a mask, just a stick with a feather on it. Signed, StoryMaker. "Gotta trust the kid's review!"
