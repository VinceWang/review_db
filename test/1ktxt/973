review/text: Dear Sirs: I'd like to make my brief sketch of my past career. Whe I was little,I used to make some performances even in my class at a elementary school,such as comical actions,reading a poem with the too-exagerated and help make attractiveness from other cute/smart girl classmates,althoug seemingly,I have only few memories for me to study homeworks after school,but I had stood top groups about the results of regular tests. I feel, I had turned my focuss upon studying when entering a top ranked high-school in Osaka,Japan, the excellent school;each classmates used to be a very brainy/smart with the background before, had a brilliant school histories. Those days,IQ TEST(mental ability test) had been available,and as far as my memory serves, in a few times,informed me of my scores from the teacher, I do not all of them,but a IQ Score of mine was 154 or such,just still in my memory.
