review/summary: 1 year old fun!
review/text: My daughter received these for her 1st birthday and were a big hit as soon as we took them out of the bag. Right now she just likes the noise they make as well as the size of the blocks. I have a feeling they will be a favorite as she can start to recognize the shapes in the blocks and use them to spell words as she gets older.Great gift for a toddler!
