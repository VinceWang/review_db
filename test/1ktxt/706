review/summary: The Truth on King James!
review/text: I first heard about Lebron when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and followed him ever since. I thought I read a lot about him, but reading this book told me so much that I had never known about Lebron as a player, a person, and all the hype and attention he got from the media, the shoe companies and everyone else. The fact that he dealt with so many distractions and people hating on him and still succeeded was really inspirational. This book has tons of info and quotes from Lebron, and it shows that he seems like a cool guy, too. I would definitely recommend this book if you're a fan of Lebron or just a fan of basketball and sports in general.
