review/summary: AWESOME BOOK
review/text: This was a very cool book. It had a ton of great inside stuff I didn't know about The Man. The sneaker stuff was really interesting. Clearly LeBron was under enormous pressure to perform and to do the right thing, and even with the scounts and everything esle going on he gave 100% to his high school team, The Irish. Jones does a great job taking us inside the making of a star.
