review/summary: No instructions included - do not trust seller
review/text: Promised with this item are "Complete Instructions" and the additional pledge that "Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time!" I received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet. To boot, Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller. All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer. Let's hope that yields some results. Meanwhile, I'm wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller :/
