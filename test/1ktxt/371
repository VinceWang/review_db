review/summary: The Quick Trip Around Europe!
review/text: This guide is great for an overview of many of the great places in Europe - but I cannot believe anyone would consider using this as their only guide. It should be used to maybe narrow down places to visit- then more comprehensive guides should be used. I have never been a believer in those 1 and 2 days in 18 cities over 3 weeks tours. 1 or 2 days is certainly not enough time to fully appreciate and get to know any city you visit. Furthermore, this guides biggest flaw is in doesn't cover anything in central/eastern europe besides the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary! Where's Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, etc....? Yes, Europe is big but the countries not contained in this guide have so much to offer and certainly should not be overlooked. For example, St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - not mentioned here!Don't rush Europe - relax and enjoy it. Take time to get to know the people and cities. This guide can certainly help to narrow down Europe - but should certainly not be relied upon for extensive info on the many great places.
