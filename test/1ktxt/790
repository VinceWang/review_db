review/summary: Still got the toy since 1974
review/text: I've had this toy since I was a year old or so (honestly, I've had it for as long as I can remember). I can't believe they're still around. My 5 year old has inherited mine. She loves it very much. There isn't much too it, but for some reason she loves it just as much as I did. It's a great toy that is trans-generation. I'm sure someday my daughter will pass it on to her child, too. Henry the Dog will be around forever.
