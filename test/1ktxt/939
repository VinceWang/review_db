review/summary: Great for kids and parents alike!!!
review/text: When I was in my early teen years, my mom had a set of these for a couple of the kids she babysat. I liked to even then play with these blocks with the kids because they were so interactive and had lots of variety. Now that I'm a dad, I decided that our little 8 month old should have a set to play with. His eyes lit up when seeing them and really loves is when daddy builds them into a tower that he can come an knock down. I'm sure that they are going to be used for years and years to come.They are super durable. The plastic is hard and the pieces are fit together so well that I doubt that they will every come apart without a significant amount of effort by an adult. They are a bit pricey but I feel that they are worth the investment as they will be toys I expect my grandkids to be able to play with someday.
