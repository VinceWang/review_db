review/summary: Great game for little girls!
review/text: My 6 and 7 year old daughters love this game! They really enjoy decorating the rooms and doing so has really improved their mouse skills. Essentially, a lot of the game is kind of like "coloring" on the computer and they love to color. Hunting for the gems in each room is fun for them. There is also a maze at the end as well as a bunch of sappy songs that they seem to really enjoy. This is a great choice for girls 4-9 years old.
