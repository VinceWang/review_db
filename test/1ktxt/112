review/summary: One of the best video game soundtracks out there.
review/text: With Vagrant Story, Sakimoto expertly combines dissonance, ambience and melody to create a simply gorgeous videogame score. In fact, I'm going to call it one of Squaresoft's best. There is not one dud in the soundtrack. It's even better in-game, but buy the soundtrack!
