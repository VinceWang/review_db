review/text: All Europe guides are, of necessity, a selection of the very best things to see and do in that vast continent. No one book could be comprehensive, and all Europe guides are pretty bulky and heavy. But the Eyewitness people have managed to fit an astonishing number of places into 800 pages - and their choices are always exactly right, especially for the first-time visitor. It can be hard to decide whether to go to Antwerp or Bruges or Brussels - if you only have time to go to one city in Belgium - and all the photographs and illustrations in this book, plus the informative descriptions, make it a lot easier to make up your mind. The maps alone, all in color, make it worth buying.
