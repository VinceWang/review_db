review/summary: Brilliant Words and Harmony
review/text: A fantastic collection of songs by one of Germany's top songwriters and singers. Similar to Simon and Garfunkel with a bit of Bob Dylan. Haunting melodies and brilliant lyrics.Mey is an impressive talent. This collection of twelve songs include social commentary (Atze Lehman, Zwischen Keiz and Ku'damm, Mein guter alter Balthasar), love songs (both love in bloom -Du bist die Stille (You Are the Stillness)- and love in gloom - Einen Koffer in jeder Hand (A Suitcase in Each Hand) and Es schneit in meinen Gedanken (It's snowing in my thoughts) as well as Mey's trademark humorous songs,The latter include: (1) &quot;Weil Ich ein Meterologe bin&quot; (Because I am a Weatherman) which describes the plight of a weatherman who everyone despises because of his poor forecasts (2) Die Homestory (The Homestory) which describes a celebrity's encounter with journalists ostensibly coming to interview him for an article on how his career began but who over spend their time eating and drinking to the extent that when the article finally appear it describes him as &quot;speechless how it all began&quot; because the journalists have not done their jobs (3) Hab Erdol in Garten (I Have Oil in My Garden) about a homeowner who decides to plant strawberries in his garden and apparently discovers oil. After all the changes this brings (fame, lost friends appearing), he discovers that all he has done is rupture an oil pipeline. (5) Es gibt tage, da wunscht Ich, Ich war mein Hund (There are Days I Wish I were My Dog).If you understand German, you will obviously enjoy this CD more. The CD includes the lyrics (in German) which can be a real help if like me you are not fluent.If you don't speak German, sit back and enjoy the music.
