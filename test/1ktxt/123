review/summary: A lovely story
review/text: I was surprised, and so touched, by this movie. What a delightful find! A friend recommended it, and they weren't wrong at all. The story is lovely, with a lot of heart. The actress who plays Elena is beautiful. And the locations! Wow. I want to visit there, wherever this is. The story gave me hope, and inspiration, and a desire to have my own magic happen by the sea!! Really, a must watch, good to cuddle up with a loved one.
