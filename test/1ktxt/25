review/summary: A bunch of money. Let's have this un-imported or something!
review/text: I enjoyed the game at first, then after a few years a vivid memory of my enjoyment came to me. I couldn't figure the reason it supplanted so strong into me. I played it again after some time, Then i figured it. The music. The game opens with the only fully orchestrated peice, still by the composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Mitsuda synthesizes the rest, nothing of his music is second rate. I couldn't believe a single person sat behind a synthesizer, perhaps with countless samples at his disposal, and created this wonderful accompanyment to the game. When I bought this soundtrack, This very one, it cost me a wopping 50 bucks. I enjoyed the purchase and didn't whine about it because of the quality jump from when listening while playing the game. When you listen to the soundtrack with the game fresh on your mind, you notice all the instuments and sounds that we're left out, or unable to be broadcasted. The very details that made this piece more than a soundtrack. It stands alone as the greatest game soundtrack ever.
