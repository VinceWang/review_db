review/summary: Henry dog
review/text: There is something that Henry Dogs brings to a child. It's a simple toy, but such an amazing thing that happens when a child connects to it with love, companionship, and comfort. I first got my Henry Dog when I was 2 years old and it has bought much joy throughout my childhood. Now 35 years later, I still have my Henry Dog which sits in an old wicker chair in a corner of the guest room. My brother also had a Henry Dog back in the 70s, he too still has kept his Henry Dog for over 30 something years. He took his Henry Dog everywhere just as I had as a child. The Henry Dog has bought so much enjoyment as we grew up and still has a priceless value throughout our adult years. Most stuff animals children grow out of, but there is something with the Henry Dog that makes us want to hold on to it. I still love my Henry Dog, and best of all, my Henry Dog reminds me of a simple thing in life, to live life happy. Thank you for bring happiness to so many with the Henry Dog. I'm still waiting for the Henry Dog to be in stock one day so I can gift my child a Henry Dog to love and adore.
