review/summary: Alphabet blocks don't make individual sounds on Incrediblock.
review/text: Bought these for my baby along with the Incrediblock. The blocks are adorable, but when you put them on the Incrediblock, it doesn't make individual letter sounds for them, which is what I expected for the price.It turns out that only the 13 blocks that come with the Incrediblock make any kind of individual noises. These just play random music, which is fine, but I really bought this for the purposes of it being a really educational toy, which it really isn't at this point.The description really should explicitly tell you this.
