review/summary: Too much sugar is bad for you
review/text: I remember playing Outrun in the arcades when it came out in the, I think it was, eighties. It had flashy graphics, flashy steering wheel, pedals, and corny, but catchy, music. It was the kind of game I'd play on the way out of the arcade when all but the last dribbles of coinage had been spent on the more 'serious' (read challenging) games. Actually, when I think about it, Outrun was always placed by the entrance, perhaps for this reason. Main meal of games inside, followed by quick dessert on the way out. And Outrun is quick. And fun. And flashy. Colourful, pretty, and simple. Not much depth here, but some very cool twists on your standard arcade racer. Lots of different Ferraris, lots of different scenery and, wow, does it look good! Pure, unadulterated eye candy. Two problems, however. It wont run on full accelerated sound on my sound card (budget Creative), so I have to switch the acceleration back to minimum through my control panel or the game will just keep crashing when it comes time to race. Secondly, the configuration for gamepad bites. It won't allow me to allocate the buttons I want for acceleration and braking, so I end up using the right analogue joystick for both (left to accelerate, right to brake). Sounds dicky, and I suppose it is, but it's actually pretty easy to get used to. As far as I'm aware there are no patches for said problems. Despite these issues Outrun 2006 C2C is a blast, fun from go to wo. It's sugary sweet and just the thing for a low gaming BSL.
