review/summary: Preaching over heavy dub
review/text: I'm suprised that no one has reviewed this album. This is Prince Far I's first recording though I believe "Under Heavy Manners" was released before. On this CD, Prince Far I reads out a number of psalms over some really raw, heavy and pulsating dubs. This is a must for anyone who appreciates DJ-rap music.
