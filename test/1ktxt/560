review/summary: Treat Yourself to Life (1954)
review/text: Considered a classic in the field, TREAT YOURSELF TO LIFE continues to be regarded as one of the best of many guides available to deal with life's challenges. Dr. Barker emphasizes that most psychological techniques lack a spiritual premise with which to bring health, prosperity, and well-balanced personal relationships into action. By changing the subconscious patterns that derail even the best of intentions, you can reprogram yourself for success through Dr. Barker's spiritual mind treatment approach. In getting this book, you are doing something of value for yourself.
