review/summary: Cuddly friend for life
review/text: I have owned a Henry Dog for almost 38 years! He is a wonderful stuffed animal. I used to take him everywhere with me. He does have some battle wounds and stitches, but he's almost 40 years old. :) I think Henry is a great friend for kids. I love the "old-fashioned" toys of my youth that spark a child's imagination and creativity and Henry is one of those toys!
