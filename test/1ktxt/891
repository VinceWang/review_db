review/summary: A must have for every baseball fan
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best baseball magazine there is out there. Every other week readers are privy to the same information that general managers and scouts receive on their desks. As the title reads, it's about "Baseball America" not just the major leagues but about the entire sport. A real dream for any true fan. Every year the top prospects from the minors to high school are covered. There is great team by team analysis and opinion. And of course, plenty of major league news. One little section that I forgot to mention is the obituaries. Yes; obituaries! Just to give even more of an indication as to how deeply this sport is covered, obituaries of past major and minor leaguers are provided for the true baseball historian. A great magazine that no true fan should be without. And if there isn't enough reason for you to get it, subscribers can now access the online edition!
