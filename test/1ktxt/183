review/summary: Incredible charger! Low price too!
review/text: This battery charger only takes three, yes THREE hours to charge up to 4 AA or AAA batteries. Some of my friends' chargers take 8 hours (overnight) to a full day to charge batteries and they hate it. They paid the same or even more for their chargers too! Switch to this charger and you will never complain. It is one of the fastest chargers and also includes four AA 1700 mAh NiMH batteries which is valued up to $ so this is a great buy. One of the best chargers because it is lightweight, the plug can be folded into the charger, and is super fast!
