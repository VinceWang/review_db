review/summary: Tangerine Dream member cuts loose and outdoes his own group!
review/text: Energetic guitarwork over spacey electronic soundscapes make this the best Tangerine Dream release not by Tangerine Dream!Son of Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese the first solo project by Jerome Froese is far better than his father's solo projects.With the exception of the great musical pieces on Tangerine Dream's new Jean D'Arc the instrumental pieces on this album outshine most recent Tangerine Dream releases!Back in the mainstream Gwen Stefani had huge success when she made her solo album without her group No Doubt.Jerome Froese achieves that same level of success here.If you're a Tangerine Dream fan the solo releases of Edgar Froese aren't really essential.Neptunes however is essential to all Tangerine Dream fans.
