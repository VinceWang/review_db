review/summary: The Best Soundtrack By SquareSoft
review/text: Yes indeed, the game was beautiful. Too bad no one really knows about it. When i played the game I absolutely loved it. A true masterpiece one of squaresofts best by far. But when I got the Soundtrack it was mind blowing. Every Song was on it. Plus the caftsmanship from the director was just overwhelming. The game and soundtrack by far are the best in squaresofts history. Never has there been a great combination. From Listening threw out Disc one which features some really cool Resident Evil only in symphony mode. Yes this Soundtrack is by far the best Video Game soundtrack that I have ever gotten. All I have to say is get the game first once you beat it. Get the soundtrack next. You'll know what I mean by what a true RPG game and music is all about.
