review/summary: Daughter loved it, but finished it in a day.
review/text: My daughter loved this game, and it really kepted her at the computer for hours, but it was finished in one day at our house. It was a long day, but still one day. The positives about the game though is that they can go back and redecorate the castle different the next time they play, so my dayghter actually played it again a few days later so she could see what the castle would look like if she decorated it differently.
