review/summary: Chrono Cross: Mitsuda's crowning achievement.
review/text: For those of you who have played the game, you are all too familiar with the various themes throughout the soundtrack. From the moving and dramatic opening song, &quot;Time's Scar,&quot; the upbeat and fun &quot;Dancing the Tokage,&quot; and the eerie vocal track &quot;Radical Dreamers,&quot; this soundtrack satiates those of us with diverse tastes in music.However, for those of you who can't equate love of the soundtrack with love of the game (heaven forbid), then here is some information that you will probably value. Some of the tracks border on celtic themes, while others are of the more traditional classical style of music. There is one vocal song (as mentioned previously) that is absolutely beautiful, even if it is sung in Japanese. Although the music is synthesized, the sounds are so crisp that, for the most part (especially with the opening), you can't tell that the piece is not being performed by real instruments. The synthesized music goes so far as to include &quot;accidentals,&quot; such as the sound of fingers travelling down the guitar strings, which adds to a more realistic sound.I highly reccommend this soundtrack (3CDs) for anyone who enjoys listening to excellent, well written music. Mitsuda's talent is well displayed in this soundtrack (he also wrote the music to Chrono Trigger and Xenogears). If you are leery about jumping into a purchase before sampling some mp3's (don't worry, I'm the same way), then I suggest listening to the three songs I listed in the first paragraph. They are a good representation of the whole, although there are MANY other tracks that are excellent as well.
