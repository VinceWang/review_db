review/summary: I Can't Believe I Missed This
review/text: I don't know if anyone else thinks like me but the Electronic Dance scene has been a little stale as of late. Daon't get me wrong, I'm an electronic dance music fan through & through, just lately there hasn't been anything that's really jumped out at me. The minimal tech scene is getting waaaaaaaaaaay too much attention and nice, infectious, groovy, uplifting whatevers are no where to be found. Anyway, I'd heard of this album but never paid too close attention to it. I had no idea what I'd been missing. HOLY SH!T am I impressed, this is exactly whats been missing for the past couple years. I've been waiting for this for so long, yet here it was this whole time. From beginning to end this CD grabs hold & doesn't let go, simply amazing music from start to finish. Do all yourselves a favor and buy this CD, it's finally available domestically, there's no reason not to own it. You'll thank me later.
