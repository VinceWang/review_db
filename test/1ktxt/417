review/summary: &quot;Adia&quot; by Oliver Ngoma
review/text: I heard this album at a cousin's pub in Kampala, Uganda a few months ago, and was duly impressed. I love Afro beats, and this is a good representation of Zouk music, a form of Afro/Caribbean Soca cum Lingala music. The production is excellent. I was surprised that I had not heard of Oliver Ngoma before. This is a must have for Afro music lovers.
