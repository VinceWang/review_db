review/summary: I did not hear this CD, I heard something better.
review/text: I heard Gene O'Quin sing most of these songs in person. In the early 50s I spent most every Saturday night at the ElMonte Leigon Stadium for Cliffy Stones Hometown Jamboree (sorta like a west coast Grand ol Opery). Gene was a regular along with the likes of Molly Bee and Tennessee Ernie Ford.He had a singing style that grabbed your attention. I heard the original, the recording of that voice would rate a 5.
