review/text: Hi,I'm 'BARBIE LOVER' and I really like this game,even though I'm a bit out of the age range. :) I like going around and decorating every room in the castle differently each time I play!(like the whole castle decorated with peacocks or swans or butterflies,or one room has horses and another masqarade masks,exc.)The thing which really nags me is that every time you have 12 names on your list you have to erase one to play again.I usually just erase the whole list so I won't have to do this that often. I also like the intro to the game,and the muscic in each room before you restore it. I even reconized a bit of music from the movie! If you love Fantasy,dragons,and rapunzel you should get the movie-and this very fun game!(The movie is very nice,even though it is 4 years old!)And another thing-Barbie's mask is not a mask-it is just a feather in the air-have you seen it? PS Please vote on my review! 'BARBIE LOVER'
