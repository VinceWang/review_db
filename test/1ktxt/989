review/summary: Cory Everson's Total Body Workout
review/text: This video hit all the spots most women have troubles with. Cory's videos are really good. She's very positive. I weight train 4 days a week and do Aerobis on my alternating day's, this is a great alternating day workout. It is also good for beginer's. I'm a certified personal trainer and have been exercising for 17 years not to many workouts are really a challange, still looking for one . If you'll try this one you may like it, it's great for starters. Keep Moviated! Good luck!
