review/summary: Imprecise Recipes Make Bad Bread
review/text: It's quaint, I'll give it that. The handwritten style and illustrations are reminiscent of, perhaps, an early scratch draft of "The Moosewood" done with a sharpie instead of a nib and ink. But the recipes for bread are poorly assembled.Any bread maker knows how the proportionality of ingredients is key for bread. I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don't expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast? The kinds in this book!I'm not claiming to be an expert on bread, but I've made two loaves a week for 2 years now, with a lot of success with other cookbooks (America's Bread Book, The Bread Book, My Bread); I think this one is lame. I'm glad it's my housemate's and that I didn't pay for it.
