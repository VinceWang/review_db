review/summary: Academia At It's Best
review/text: When I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas my first impression went along these line: "Oh great some professor who probably wrote alot of mumbo-jumbo that I don't want to know about Dr. Suess and I know it won't be an enjoyable read."Thanks goodness I read it nonetheless.To my pleasure, Nel hardly writes in the airy academia style with which I expected him to. In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. "Dr. Seuss: American Icon" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more. Highly recommended!
