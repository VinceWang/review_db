review/summary: Thank You Norma
review/text: Until today I had never heard of Norma Gregory, But like a lot of pyro artist pyrography came way after being an artist.In my 40's I decided to learn pyrography,I've done it for ten years now and as much as I love doing this type of art I found it harder to find new subjects Until I picked up this book. Page after page the Author lets the reader see so many Designs and Ideas. I'm not a writer,and I've never done a review. But I do know enough that this is a great book for beginers or Pyrographers who have been at it awhile. William Hough
