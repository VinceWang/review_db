review/summary: Another must!
review/text: Along with Bap-tizum this lp is a must and aptly documents the excitement that was the Art Ensemble of Chicago in the early 70's. From the lyrical exploration of &quot;Illistrum&quot; to the freeform taunting of the title track to the classically influenced &quot;Tnoona&quot; each and every song takes you on a sonic spiritual journey that few jazz records ever achieve. It's interesting to note that they did not release another album for five years and when they did their music had changed somewhat which makes this record that much more important as it is the final document of their first phase and an important one it is.
