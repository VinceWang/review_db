review/summary: Kodak Max K2000 Battery Charger with 4 NiMH AA Batteries
review/text: I just bought this battery charger a few months ago and it works PERFECTLY with my Canon PowerShot A60. It charges up to 4 AA or AAA batteries in LESS THAN 3 HOURS ALL THE TIME!The charger is small and easily portable so you can bring it with you anywhere for quick charging.The only downside to the charger I have found so far is that you can't leave it in the outlet overnight or it will overheat, so you have to come back to it in 3-4 hours. Other than that, this is THE charger to buy!
