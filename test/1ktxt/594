review/summary: Loved it!
review/text: This book was a perfect historical romance for teens! It is set in Scotland in the 1500s. Tess has lived on a desolate island ever since she was a little girl, raised by its caretakers who are now dead, leaving 17-year-old Tess alone. She is rescued by Colin MacPherson, a handsome young Highlander, who takes her back to the mainland. He tries to help her find her heritage, but the two end up falling in love. This book was the best Avon True Romance, it was just soooo sweet and romantic and I loved the Scottish Medieval setting.
