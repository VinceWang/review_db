review/summary: Dorie's story of hope and healing
review/text: This is Dorie Van Stone's complete story - the sometimes graphic details that were left out of her book, "Dorie, the Girl Nobody Loved". This book gives hope to those who have been abused or who work with those who have. God had his hand on Dorie and brought her full circle to a place of healing where she is now ministering to others - an amazing true story!
