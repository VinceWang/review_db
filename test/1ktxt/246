review/summary: Best people-handling skills ever
review/text: I've watched this before and I come back to it often enough that I felt that owning it was worthwhile - watching it is like having a drink while listening to smooth jazz (if that's your thing) or some really decadent dark chocolate in front of a fire (if that's your thing)...there's something delicious in the way the characters handle all the (sometimes touching, sometimes silly, sometimes suspenseful) situations, so smoothly, handling guests in such a way that they don't know they're being handled. I aspire to deal with office politics and ruffled customers the way the staff of Hotel Babylon do!
