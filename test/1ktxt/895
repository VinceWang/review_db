review/summary: Brand X , The X Files... One Guy`s Opinion
review/text: This is the first I have heard from Brand X since the early 80`s. Disc 1 contains mostly live cuts from various times and places, going from recently to the past. The playing is great and so are the tunes, but the sound is sometimes rather raw. Disc 2 contains cuts from various projects Goodsall and Jones have been involved in outside of Brand X. Some of it is good,while some of it will never vibrate my speakers again.Drum fans will enjoy the variety of excellent drummers. If you want to get into Brand X, this is not the best place to start( go back to the late 70`s stuff). This one has some excellent moments but would have probably been better as one disc, rather than two.
