review/text: This soundtrack trancends games alone. It brings you into a world that does not end. I cannot tell you how many hours I have spent listening to it over and over again and still enjoy every second of it. The music itself surpases its gaming origins, it easily stands on its own. It is full and vibrant using all aspects of tradition orchastral composition. A must have for any gamer that collects soundtracks and a must have for anyone that enjoys a good solid classical score.
