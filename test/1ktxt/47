review/summary: Truly a timeless masterpiece...
review/text: For many RPG fans, Chrono Trigger (for the SNES) was considered to be one of the best RPGs ever made. Squaresoft didn't disappoint loyal fans when they unexpectedly came out with Chrono Cross for the PlayStation. Along with Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger, I would have to these three games to be the best RPGs of all time.Since I myself am a music buff, I usually rate games and music based on the soundtrack and character development, rather than the actual gameplay and battle system. I won't go into other aspects of the game (see the Chrono Cross PlayStation reviews), but Chrono Cross, lives up to its reputation in all the categories.The music brings in themes from Chrono Trigger (e.g. Track 04 contains music from its predecessor), plus introduces brand new themes with lots of different influences (e.g. the Celtic quality of the introduction theme). Overall, the music is one of the best I've heard for anything (including games and movies), well-deserving a 10 out of 10.
