review/summary: A "Treasury" is the Right Word.
review/text: I was happy to discover that these recordings have just been re-released, because my old vinyl copy of the theater songs has seen better days. I was very pleased to see that this re-issue now includes transliterated lyrics and English translations, which were missing from the version I had, and which are a tremendous help to language students. (I was sorry to see they had omitted "Got Fun Avrohom" from the collection, though, because it's one I've always loved -- but I still have it on the vinyl.)I agree this collection is a treasury, both in the sense that these beloved songs are treasures, but also in the sense that they are preserved here now and protected for posterity. Many nearsighted people don't care that the Yiddish culture that once thrived in Eastern Europe before the war is on the brink of disappearing forever.With only a few Yiddish-speaking enclaves left now, in cities like Winnipeg, Montreal, and New York City, the vibrant cultural heritage that these songs embody may become extinct within our lifetimes, or perhaps those of our children. And the world will be much the poorer.
