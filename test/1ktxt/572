review/summary: Outstanding vintage hillbilly boogie! Thank you Bear Family : - )
review/text: This wonderful 30 track CD of Gene Oquin's offerings will have ya tappin' your toes, slappin' your knees, and grinnin' from ear to ear! With all due respect to Hank Williams Sr, Gene Oquinn is just as good, if not better! Rich with steel guitar, fiddles, honky-tonk style piano playin', and serious twang in Gene's vocals, this CD simply ROX!!! Recorded over 50 years ago, the audio quality will give you chills...it's that good! If you enjoy real down-home hillbilly boogie, please buy this CD. It will be a crown in your CD collection. Thank you Bear Family!
