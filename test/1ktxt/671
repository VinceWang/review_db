review/summary: Ummmmm... HELL YAH!!!
review/text: If one were interested in my reviews he would see that the few I have have laid towards the negative. Not the case here. Third Mix is the king of all DDR, with all songs being somewhat speedy and having a good beat (5 or so don't) this soundtrack is tight. This one is actually worth 50.00, forget any other soundtrack.
