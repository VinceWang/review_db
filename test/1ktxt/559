review/summary: Harnessing thought-power
review/text: Dr Baker was one of those great 20th century metaphysicians like Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes &Thomas Troward, who understood the working of the mind long before psychotherapy became popular. This approach is called "the religion of healthy mindedness" by William James in his classicThe Varieties of Religious Experience.Barker explains clearly and engagingly how to improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called `treatment.' The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are thedivine thought processin the individual.This wonderful guide provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alias, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy,Catherine Ponderand Florence Scovel-Shinn, the book should be read repeatedly to derive the maximum benefit.
