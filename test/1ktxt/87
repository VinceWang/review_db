review/summary: Five stars it not enough
review/text: I thought this book was brilliant. The plot was so good that it kept me guessing until the end. It worked its way into my heart and I can't help every now and then thinking about Maxwell, Heath and Julia. This is so great, I love this new writer and I can't wait for the next book. &lt;hint, hint> A must read for anyone with a beating heart.
