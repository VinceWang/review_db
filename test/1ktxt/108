review/summary: You have to read this book
review/text: I can not talk this book up enough. It was well writen and a major page turner. It was a book about a pastor that falls for a member of his congregation. It will leave your heart full and your mind pondering question of infidelity and what is right and wrong and where God draws the line. It is a must read.
