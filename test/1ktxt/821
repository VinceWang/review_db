review/summary: Short stories that use Jewish peasant life to express notions of more universal import
review/text: THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of "Yanda" is a provincial prostitute, while "Zeitl and Rickel" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a "take a book, leave a book" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable.
