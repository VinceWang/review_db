review/summary: Henry the world traveller
review/text: I had the original Henry in the 70's, now my mother has it at their house. My mom takes Henry with her on all of her international trips because he fits nicely in her carry-on thus he becomes her companion. He has been beaten up throughout the years therefore Henry wears a patch over his left eye. Oh well. My dog liked him too. I had a Henry and a Snoopy during my toddler days of the 70's. They were best buddies. Now Snoopy kicks it down in Florida at my parents winter home and travels up North for the summer to hang out with Henry, that's if he's not in Europe somewhere. Priceless.
