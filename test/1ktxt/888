review/summary: Tough subject to deal with
review/text: Another great book to keep in a library of counselor and clinical journals. Having an understanding of what a patient/client is referring to when they are coming to grips with sexual abuse is important to a provider of care and support. This is one of a set of books geared toward educating the person, the counselor, as well as the general public in the harms caused by sexual abuse, but it also highlights the resilency of the person who has gone through it.
