review/summary: Think twice about purchasing this video prior to viewing
review/text: This was the second of Cory's tapes that I have purchased and was equally if not more so, disappointed. Not having the opportunity to view it, I purchased it based on customer ratings from Amazon. If music and environment is important to you, this is not the right video. The music is not aligned at all with the movement, and either is her counting. Though there are five sections for a full body workout, the exercises are jerky and inefficient. There is no pre-instruction or notice prior to each exercise in addition to little to no safety in the movements or shifting from one to another. Though Cory's reputation with regard to her bodybuilding is well noted, I will not be purchasing any other tapes from her collection. It is the first &quot;instructor of tapes I have noted, wearing evening gown length earrings in her workouts and she and the members of her training look more like first timers for the Playboy collection than serious and directed workout members. Their &quot;bums&quot; are bare for the workouts. All these factors combined, I find them more &quot;show&quot; than anything else.
