review/summary: Alaska Sourdough
review/text: I already have a couple of Sourdough books and I was looking for a bit more detail. This book was partially what I was looking for and had some good tips. I would buy it again but am still looking for a bit more detail and information about using it. Additional recipes ie: biscuits and whole grain breads would be more along what I want.
