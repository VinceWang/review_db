review/summary: cant cook sourdough without it
review/text: Bought this in 1982 and used it thoroughly for years until it fell apart and was held together with rubber bands, paper clips, and clothes pins...then it got away. This book is as much fun just to read as it is to cook from. Full of Alaskan lore, great recipes, and if you are into sourdough, or think you might be, this may be the only recipe book you'll ever need for just plain family eating: breads, biscuits, hot cakes, waffles, and anecdotes.
