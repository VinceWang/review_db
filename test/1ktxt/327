review/summary: Alaska Sourdough
review/text: I received this book as a BD gift... I love it! I live in SE Alaska, a subsistance life style... been trying to learn how to "grow" a really good sourdough... this book has been really helpful and it has some really great recipes from the early 1900's and before! Now, if I can just figure out the quirks of baking and keeping a good sourdough "growing" on my salmon troller...If you love great sourdough, give this a try... "grow" your own using one of Ruth's recipes (included)... it is well worth the time and your guests will truly enjoy the meals you make from your sourdough jar...h. akinsnaukati, ak
