review/summary: One of My Favorites Naxos Sor Discs
review/text: This is the 9th CD I've purchased in the Naxos 10 CD "complete" solo guitar works of Fernando Sor. I'm surprised that no one else has reviewed it, because it's easily one of the best in the series for pure listening pleasure. Op. 10 and 12, both extended works ("Fantasies"), are quite enjoyable, but Op. 11--which includes a series of 12 wonderful Minuets-- truly seems a masterpiece and is probably one of Sor's greatest works. Listening to these short pieces, one can really appreciate Sor's influence on Agustin Barrios (considered by many to be the greatest classical guitar composer of all time). John Holmquist, one of America's premier guitarists, performs these works skillfully and expressively, with a delightful, singing quality. Highly recommended.
