review/summary: We Love This Game!
review/text: I bought this game to bring down to my vacation home, a new game that the kids do not have at home. Every time we go to the house, the kids want to play Gobblet first! It is just like tic-tac-toe, but you can eat up your opponent's pieces with your own larger pieces. It is a game of strategy. My 7 year old enjoys beating her 17 year old cousins in this game, before they figure out how to do it. My 5 year old can beat his cousins as well. I would recommend it.
