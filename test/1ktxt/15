review/summary: Great music to a classic game.
review/text: Attn: Do not purchase from Art_of_Music, copies from this store are bootleg and had terrible sound quality. The soundtrack was released by Miya records, a well known bootlegger, for their poor quality. Seller responded to all my emails until he received the return. I sent several emails to the seller, but never heard from him. I ended up having to go through Amazon's claims to get my refund.Music made me play the game again. I had played Chrono Trigger so many times, but only played Chrono Cross once. The music was so fun to listen to while playing, so I'm going to re-order the soundtrack from Amazon and wait however long it takes for it to ship.I just found out that Chrono Cross is getting released on the Playstation Network. Should be good.
