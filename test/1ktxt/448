review/summary: Mac Users Beware
review/text: We were glad to find a Barbie PC game that can run on a Mac. However, note that the requirements to run the game on a Mac are: Power Mac, G3 266 MHz or faster processor, Mac OS 8.6, 9.1.2, 9.2, or 10.1.2. We have a Mac running OS 10.2.8 (just the next version). I assumed the game would still be compatible since most software can run on an OS that is slightly greater than the one required. This game will not work with OS 10.2.8 at all. I planned on calling Apple to see if there was some plug-in/fix I could download to make it work, but never got around to it.Luckily, my Mom has a Windows PC, so my 5 year old daughter gets to play the game when she goes to Grandma's house. She LOVES the game and has not gotten tired of it at all (but she can play once or twice a month). The concept is fun and straight forward, and has more than 1 level. She got the game when she was 4 and had no problems learning how to use it, but she's always been pretty good on the computer.
