review/summary: Jill Malter
review/text: Jill Malter gives a terrible review to any book that dares to say, even in the most timid way, that the Palestinians might have the teeniest bit of a point. The pattern suggests that this is her automatic reaction to any book that does not agree with her prejudices. So please disregard her reviews; they are biased in the extreme.
