review/summary: Thanks Barbie!!
review/text: I purchased this for my daughter that had just turned 5 and with a little help from me in the maze area she was able to finish the game rather quickly (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but to my surprise she still wants to play it over and over again redecorating the castle differently each time room, by room. She has figured out the maze area on her own now as well, at first naviagating Barbie is a little difficult, but all in all as a rainy day game she loves it! Sometimes I have to set the timer to get her off the computer. Not a lot in the way of learning, but that is what her "Reader Rabbit" CD-Rom's are for anyway - this one is for fun! Additionally I didnot have any technical problems setting up this CD for my daughter, and I have had with many others including her Reader Rabbit, and Disneys.
