review/summary: The Fabulous Miss Gloria Lynne!!!
review/text: Gloria Lynne has one of the most beautiful and distinct voices I have ever heard. Her voice is as plush as velvet and as sweet as honey. I consider her to be one of the few real divas left from the old school, members of which include Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Nancy Wilson, and Betty Carter (sorry if I may have left out any of your personal favorites).Every song on this album is excellent, along with the jazzy orchestration, which is probably why it was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1990. Gloria gives a freshness to "He's Out Of My Life", almost making it a new song. The mellow sound of "You Keep Turning Me On," is reminiscent of the small jazz clubs where the singer knows many of the audience members by name. The title song "A Time For Love", shows off Gloria's early classical training and withstands the test of time. Her jazzier side is highlighted in the tune "But Beautiful" and "Love Is Blind." Gloria knows how to sing all types of music and her blues like approach to "Trust In Me" is heartwrenching yet warming. Her delivery of "I Thought About You", and "Come Get Your Share" is light and whimsical and makes you feel happy all over. Of course you can't go wrong in ending such a splendid album with the old favorite "I'm In The Mood For Love', and I think after listening to this album we all will be in the mood!!This Album is a winner for me!!!!!
