review/summary: Have You Had Your Breakfast Today?
review/text: I originally purchased this soundtrack from an importer when I heard it was coming out. And I was far from disappointed. It quickly replaced the 2nd Mix soundtrack that hardly left my CD player.This soundtrack collects the songs from the incredibly popular dancing game of the same name. It's huge over in Japan, where they're almost ready to release the 5th mix of the game, and thankfully it's finally finding its own here in the states. The soundtrack features import stars, as well as American type artists like Technotronic and Chumbawumba.And as always, the non-stop mega-mix CD provides a sweet party CD when you don't want to worry about changing the music. Trust me, as far as dance music goes, you won't be disappointed.Now if you excuse me, I have to go listen to my 4th mix soundtrack that just showed up in the mail.
