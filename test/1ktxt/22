review/summary: Amazing Game Music
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda is a genius! There's just no other way to put it. This music is beautiful, well-fitting to all of the events of the game, and especially enjoyable for those who enjoy just sitting down and listening to music. One of my favorite tracks is "Magical Dreamers - The Wind, The Stars, and The Waves" of which I have listened to over and over again. The Soundtrack is a bit pricey, but I can confidently say that it is worth every penny for the quality of music that you are purchasing. For those who are fans of the game, fans of game music, or for people who enjoy music in general, I believe this soundtrack will satisfy all of those groups of people.
