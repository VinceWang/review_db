review/summary: Out of Catalog? That's too bad...
review/text: ...somebody oughtta rerelease all of Clarence Carter's great '80's-90's Ichiban Records/CC label productions. He made some great party stuff during this era. This came shortly after his great single &quot;Strokin'&quot; (B/W &quot;Love Me With A Feeling&quot;) and I tell you, the bluesman had lost none of his friskiness or naughtiness with this one. &quot;G-Spot&quot;, &quot;Hot Dog&quot; (Baby, jam--you're the best stroker from Alabam.), and &quot;How Did You Feel&quot; all are solid multitracked, multiinstrumental, multiphonkay tracks from the talented Clarence Carter. You may ask, &quot;Zen, if its out of catalog, howcum you gotta copy of it?&quot;--one of my buddies saw it at a CD shop and bought it for me. Good looking out, man. Hopefully, you too can find it or have a buddy who looks out ferya to get it...it is rare, underrated and every track is a good'un.
