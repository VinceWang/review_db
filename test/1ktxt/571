review/summary: Honky Tonk Fever
review/text: Gene O'Quin was born in Texas, came to fame in California and died before he could gain much acclaim. Nevertheless he has become an underground favorite of fans of West Coast country, rockabily, and Texas honky tonk. This collection contains thirty songs from 1950-55 which originally appeared on the Capitol and Intro labels. This little known Texas artist deserves much more attention and a wider audience. You'll thank me for buying it.
