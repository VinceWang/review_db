review/summary: Smoldering passionate vocals~Bravo Gloria Lynne!
review/text: "A Time For Love" is clearly time for Gloria Lynne and this superb collection is an inspired musical celebration by an extraordinary singer, Gloria Lynne just gets better as time goes by. "He's Out Of My Life" is magically haunting as Miss Lynne smolders in this timeless classic that sticks with you long after it is over. Finding a funky groove in "You Keep On Turnin' Me On" creates a real cooker while "A Time For Love" becomes a torchy masterpiece and definitive version of the classic from motion picture "Romeo And Juliet". No less than three great self-penned songs show Gloria Lynne is musical through and through with "Lend Me Yesterday" exotic and haunting sounding like a great standard flowing well with other classics in this wondrous set. "But Beautiful" is hauntingly gorgeous and "Trust In Me" is a soulfully sung beautiful version of another timeless classic. Gloria and guitar make "Love Is Blind" a stunning ballad and a jazzy "I Thought About You" is sublime never sounding quite like it does here. The last Gloria Lynne original is a real cooker with Gloria turning "Come Get Your Share" inside out. As in most great works the best is saved for the finale and the stunning "I'm In The Mood For Love" is quite simply glorious. Tremendous collection is a "must have" for anyone who loves The Art Of Great Singing at a sublime peak....get this masterful collection fast while available! Bravo to you Gloria Lynne and your wonderfully gifted and greatly inspired musicans...
