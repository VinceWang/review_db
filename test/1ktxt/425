review/summary: Great Music - Packaging Needs Help
review/text: I'm not sure if the effects of the CD can match the claim or not (we shall see...) but the music IS really, really good. Very trancey, some dancey and lots of tribal/world music & atmospheric sounds. If you like Delirium, Enigma or downbeat/chill you will love this album a lot. It's definitely more 'modern' sounding and uses many different virtual instrumentation passages that are artfully arranged. Nicely recorded as well. I love popping this in and driving to work during my 'alone time', it really helps inspire some great visualizations (for me). However, don't expect fancy packaging: I thought the price was a bit steep for receiving a store bought slimline jewel case with a one-sided paper handmade insert. And the disc itself is blank. You have to be aware of what side you are putting in because there is absolutely no artwork or print on it. I've made my own cds before, and for a tiny bit extra they could have had the CDs printed at least, or had regular sized jewel cases....but that's just my personal taste perhaps. I also know that musicians are screwed out of their money in lots of other ways so maybe the extra price is partly Amazon's cut and only a portion goes to the artist (I don't doubt). Besides, it's always nice to support independent artists, so I didn't really mind. Either way, it is really lovely and unusual music for you to meditate to, groove to or imagine to. I usually have it on at work all day...I recommend it.
