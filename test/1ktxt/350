review/summary: great book---but......
review/text: This book is great. DK Travel books are the best available. The only problem I had was the seller"Discount Books". They charged me a $9.95 monthly membership fee for buying the book. And they will charge it every month until you catch them and ask them to stop. That is one thing I wouldn't have expected from an Amazon vendor. " Buyer Beware" is a must--even here.
