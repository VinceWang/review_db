review/summary: Incredible music for an incredible game.
review/text: I have many video game soundtracks, as well as anime soundtracks, and I must say that this could top them all. If I could listen to one cd before I die, this might well be it. If you haven't played the game, it really doesn't matter. The compositions should appeal to anyone who loves relaxing yet often upbeat sounds brilliantly put together. I'd definitly recommend it. While you're buying this, I'd also recommend playing the game as well (if you haven't already).
