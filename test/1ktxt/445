review/summary: Kids love it...but has annoying flaw
review/text: The kids have played this a lot, and it does seem to stimulate their creativity. To start the child enters her name...later, her name shows up during the game. It only takes them a couple of hours to go through the whole adventure. Of course, it is good enough they want to play it again. But to start over from the beginning, you must enter a new name. We started with their names, then went to full names, now on initials...next I guess we'll have to put in the dog's name. The login page has all these name variations on it, and is becoming ridiculously long. Wrote to tech support, and got the following reply:The response to your question:----------------------------------------Solution Added On 12/31/2002 2:29PMThis is true. The only way to go on is to create a new game with a new name.---------------------Well, that was very helpful.
