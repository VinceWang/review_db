review/summary: Simple Game - Started My Daughter on Computers
review/text: This game got my daughter started on computers when she was 2. She is 6 now and a computer wizard for her age. When she was 2, I had to get the game up and running and give her a hand frome time to time, but she learned to work independently. The game has two modes: storybook and interactive. Your child can view the story or they can help Barbie at many steps along the way. My daughter jumped to interactive right away. This game may be to simple for Kids over 5. The game can also help young girls feel comfortable with using a computer and learn to load games and use a mouse.
