review/summary: Yasunori Mitsuda creates another masterpiece
review/text: Once again, the composer of Chrono Trigger and Xenogears has composed a soundtrack of consistently high quality. I can't wait to see what Yasunori Mitsuda's next project, Tsugunai for the PlayStation 2, will give us.The Chrono Cross Soundtrack, while it has its share of warlike battle anthems to get your heart pounding, seems to focus on calming, Celtic-influenced songs, with lots of guitars and flutes. A nice bonus: since the game takes place in two parallel worlds, most themes have two or more versions, arranged using different tempo and instruments.This 3-CD set includes all the music from Chrono Cross. Although it's all good, highlights include: on disc 1, Scars of Time, both versions of Arni Village, and Memory - Lingering Feelings; on disc 2, Dragon Knight; and on disc 3, Time of the Dreamwatch, Life - The Faraway Promise, and The Jewel Not Stolen (sung by Noriko Mitose).The liner notes include interesting commentary about each and every single track by Mitsuda. However, remember that this is a Japanese soundtrack, and so the liner notes are in Japanese. However, there are translations of them as well as of the track list floating around if, like most Americans, you don't know Japanese.Definitely a good purchase. Well worth the price!
