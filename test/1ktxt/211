review/summary: Very very nice
review/text: Simple to set up, easy to operate - a very nice unit. Excellent & clear picture & sound. Haven't had a chance to try the VHS portion yet - the twin teens are hogging the machine, & just adore it! Good way to be able to move up to DVD while still having quick access to your VHS tapes, with the same equipment & hookup. A good choice at a reasonable price.
