review/text: After playing the game Chrono Cross, one of the main things I remembered was the gorgeous music. Each song in the game matches the mood and setting of the area. The music was apart of the game, and definatly sets the player into the right frame of mind when playing.I've always found game music to be excellent, but Yasunori Mitsuda stands out in my mind, just as Nobou Uematsu (composer of the Final Fantasy series) does.Each song sounds animated, realistic, and unique. Some of the best songs on the album (in my opinion) are Time's Scar, Another Termina, Lost Child of Time and the Brink of Death. Though I love nearly every song that I remember in the game.This soundtrack is highly recommended!
