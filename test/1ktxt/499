review/summary: Have yet to watch it yet.
review/text: I bought this movie to watch with my Thai girlfriend and did not get teh chance. She told me kn the phone she was watching it.She seemed to Enjoy it overall. When is howed this one and 1-2 to her she said its not for her. She lieks scary movies but this one did not apeal to her.Well she did watch it and enjoyed it. I wont get to watch it untill Aug. But i am looking forward to it.I gave the 3 star because i have not seen it. I would have givin it a 1 or a 2. It was moved to a three because of my girl friends opinon. First she said not for her than she said good movie. So it changed her mind.I am looking forward to it though
