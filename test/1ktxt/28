review/summary: Some of the best gaming music around.
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda is one of the best composers for video game music in my opinion. Chrono Cross is a sequal to the popular game, Chrono Trigger. Both soundtracks are composed by this person. Most of the songs on this soundtrack are unlike other soundtracks because these take a form of being more "new age" on a number of the tracks (Time's Scar for example), whereas others more guitar classical (Radical Dreamers, Another Gardopu). The diversity of these songs, and the little overlap (using the same theme over and over again - Although the theme from Magical Dreamers is used in 3-4 tracks).I highly recommend this soundtrack, especially if you played the game or like more classical/newage types of music. Out of all the gaming soundtracks I own (This is probably well over 20 or so) this soundtrack definitely is the top one I enjoy a lot. The themes on most of the songs are great, and there's enough musical diveristy to keep the songs interesting even through multiple times of listening.
