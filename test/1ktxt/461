review/summary: My 5 year old loves this
review/text: I bought this for my daughter when she was just turning 4. It is great because you don't need to know how to read in order to play. My daughter loves decorating the castle, and has played it over and over again. For some reason it gets frozen when she tries to print pictures that she makes, but other than that it is well worth the money for any little girl into princesses.
