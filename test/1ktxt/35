review/summary: Another Astounding job by Yasunori Mitsuda
review/text: once again, i'm amazed. I was playing the actual game (not the soundtrack) the other day and i thought in my mind that one of the reasons i always played that game, even though i beat it at least 2 or 3 times is because of the amazing music. so i got the soundtrack. Seriously, its amazing the music he has created with a new wide range of instruments (compared to MIDI only in his still awesome soundtrack, Chrono Trigger). this soundtrack will satisfy your mood no matter what mood you're in. from sad music to happy music to exciting music to calm music this soundtrack has pretty much everything you could want in a game soundtrack. Get this soundtrack if your a fan of Music of any type!!!
