review/summary: It started out fine, but....
review/text: I've had this for just over a month. I had read other reviews on this product prior to purchasing, and to me it seemed like it had received good reviews as simple-to-use machine with good attribues for not-so-electronic-literate person like myself. It had been working just fine, until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze, and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares, completely distorting the image. And now, the Dvd player does not even recognize any format (I've tried CDs, DVDs, and even VCDs), as it only says &quot;Incorrect Disc&quot;.I just now found another review where the person had the same problem, had to take it to a local service center, got fixed, came back, and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that, I don't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed. Since it still plays VHS perfectly fine, maybe I'll just invest in a simple DVD player, which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought a DVD/VHS combo player in the first place....
