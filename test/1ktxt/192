review/text: Although written with script authors et al in mind, Dramatica for Screenwriters is the perfect companion book for Dramatica: A New Theory of Story.Using witty and easy to understand examples, the author takes you systematically through the process of turning a meager idea into a full-blown, grand argument story via Dramatica Theory definitions. With a slight mental adjustment, the tips and advice in this book fit the novelist's dilemma as well as the screenwriter's. If you are exploring the world of Dramatica, you need this book on your shelf.
