review/summary: Beautiful...
review/text: This is easily the best video game soundtrack of the past several years, mixing a wonderful blend of soothing melodies and heart-pounding battle songs. Many of the reviews I've read on the internet like to list a few tracks that 'stand out' on this 3-disc set, but personally I think you have to listen to it all. When listening to this OST by itself, you really can't skip over any one song, espically if you've played the game all the way through at least once.Moving, spiritual music that really goes above and beyond the call of the genre. Any fan of real music should have this in their collection, it is beautiful beyond reproach. Yasunori Mitsuda is a truely brilliant composer.The liner notes that come with the set are in japanese, but a translation can be found at GameFaqs.com in the Chrono Cross section. All in all, this album is WELL worth the import price, and can be enjoyed by people of any age and musical taste.
