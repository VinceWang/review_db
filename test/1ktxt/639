review/summary: Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!
review/text: My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the "Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, "train" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse.
