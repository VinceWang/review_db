review/summary: Great Combo Package!
review/text: I decided to wait over a year to write a review on this unit, and thankfully my opinion since the first day I got it hasn't changed. It's wonderful! I was suprised to find a full feature DVD player included. A friend of mine bought a relatively expensive DVD player and it didn't have some of the features this unit has (albeit its a bit smaller). I have never experienced performance issues while using the DVD player in 12+ months. Zoom feature comes in handy as well, if you rent DVDs and don't necessarily want the whole long apect ratio. VCR works great as well. Recordings done in SP look excellent, colors are great and its not grainy at all. EP recordings look great for being EP as well, if you sit back on the couch you can't tell the difference. Only problem there is sometimes it takes a few seconds to track with EP, but it normally finds the right setting fairly quickly. The remote is easy to use once you learn it. It can be confusing at first, but now I wouldn't use anything else. It can control all the TV functions as well at the combo unit. If you want to take a small step into the world of DVD players, but not let go of your old VHS tapes, this is the player for you. Especially now, with the price quite reduced from when I bought it. You will not be disappointed!
