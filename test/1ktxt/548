review/summary: soulwax perfection once again
review/text: one word: amazing. if you like soulwax/2 many djs this is a must have. listen from beginning to end with the volume cranked up way high. you will not be disappointed. these guys need be in the american market. they'd make a huuuge impact on what you'd hear on the radio/in a club. all music should be as well made as theirs.
