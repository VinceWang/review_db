review/summary: DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FOR MACINTOSH! RIP OFF ALERT!
review/text: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM IF YOU HAVE A MACINTOSH!!! It ONLY runs on "Classic OS 9", which is an operating system over 8 years old. It does NOT run on OS X at all. A HUGE disappointment and clearly false advertising! Also, the company, BSL Mart, is very difficult to contact. There is no phone number, you can only send them e-mails. Also, the return slip was already peeled off on the packaging slip, so it is obvious that someone else already returned it and BSL Mart just slapped it right back in the package and shipped it off again anyway without even looking at it. My 5-year old daughter was so upset -- we had ordered this as a reward for her good behavior as well as doing her chores and the game is so out-dated it won't even work on a Mac OS 10.3.9 - the Panther version, which was the lowest operating system we could find. PATHETIC. I also placed this in dispute with my Visa card company, and they did put it in dispute but also informed me that in order for it to stick I have to get a "second opinion letter" from a "qualified merchant" who knows about video games! So I HAVE TO DO THE LEGWORK TO GET THIS $[...] removed from my bill - not BSL Mart! You talk about furious. I will never do business with them again. I also will never purchase a game from Amazon unless the ad SPECIFICALLY states hat it will run on a CURRENT operating system. (DUH?!) If there had been a phone number to call before I purchased it I would have but there is none. SAD.
