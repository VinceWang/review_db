review/summary: Chrono Cross OST
review/text: The music of Yasunori Misuda is without question my close second below the great Nobuo Uematsu.Chrono Cross OST is a wonderful creation filled with rich orchestra and synthesized sounds. While ambiance is one of the music's major factors, yet at times it's very uplifting and vigorous. Some of my favourite tracks include; "Scars Left by Time, The Girl who Stole the Stars, and Another World".
