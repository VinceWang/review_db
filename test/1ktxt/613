review/summary: Pretty decent but need the adjustable waist band.
review/text: I ordered these for my five year old in size 6. They are pretty decent pants but just one addition would make these pants a five,if they added the adjustable waist band feature that most of the pants her size have(the one with stretch and a button inside the waist band). Other than this one suggestion they wash and wear well.
