review/text: My 5-year-old daughter LOVED this game. It developed her creativity and held her attention long enough to finish it in one sitting. She still loves the theme song, which she memorized immediately. My two complaints: 1) Once you have completed the entire game, you must sign in under a different name in order to play again. 2) The game has no variations or higher levels to challenge the player as her skill improves. My daughter finished the game on her first attempt in about 45 minutes, but as she played more and became familiar with where all the items were, it took less and less time to finish a game. She's starting to become bored with it.One last thing (and I guess you can count this as complaint #3): will game developers EVER come up with something for girls that challenges their critical skills and doesn't involve dressup or makeovers?
