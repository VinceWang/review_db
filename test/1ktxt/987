review/summary: The best workout video ever.
review/text: I am a jogger from Minnesota and I needed an exercise tape for inside when the weather prevents me from jogging. I have just placed an order for my second Cory Everson's Total Body Workout as I am fearful that my first one will wear out. If inside exercise generally bores you to tears, Cory alleviates the problem.This is a fast paced workout with enough variety to keep you entertained. She includes a warm-up and cool down, trouble zone toning,strength training,step training and circuit training, everything a woman needs to maintain a healthy body in just one hour. It does require a step, for step aerobics, and hand held weights, but there are no gimics, no annoying music or irritating voices just a thoroughly enjoyable workout.
