review/summary: Sourdough Starter
review/text: We had been looking for a sourdough starter for quite awhile. When I saw the Alaska Sourdough kit offer on Amazon, I immediatly ordered it. When it arrived a few days later, the fun began! We made buscuits, pancakes, bread, bread sticks and are still going strong. I keep several buscuits in the fridge for quick snacks. Pop one or two in the microwave and douse with butter.The sourdough is very flavorable and easy to regenerate.I would recommend this product to anyone who has a taste for sourdough products...
