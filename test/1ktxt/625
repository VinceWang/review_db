review/summary: Great Source for Yoruba
review/text: I recommend this book highly. I have a competitor's text also and while it is useful, I appreciate the format of Beginner's Yoruba which is interactive. The companion CDs that come with this book are simply outstanding. I especially enjoy the fact that the book is respectful of ALL religions.As an update after using the CDs for a few weeks, it is true that the speaker who speaks fastest on the CD does make many mistakes. I noted errors on greetings. These are rather odd to say the least. However, I still think this is a great source! My toddler is learning right along with me and she demands I play the CD everyday! As we repeat phrases, I simply correct the errors. I really appreciate the different participants on the CD and the dialogues which are authentic and properly contextualize the vocabulary.The phrase "O'ngbiyanju" is priceless!
