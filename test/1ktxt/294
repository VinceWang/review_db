review/text: I gave this game to my son as an early birthday present. He's almost four and loves the Rescue Heroes. The reviews I read were mixed so I decided to buy it anyway. I'm really glad I did. Sure it's challenging, but it's a good excuse for the parents to get involved. First I did the hard parts for him, to show him what needed to be done. Then I guided him through them and finally he ended up doing it all by himself. He was so proud when he accomplished the hard tasks that he couldn't do at first!Unlike most computer games this one requires the use of the arrow keys instead of the mouse. Well, it's always nice to learn new skills.I can't wait to give my son the two other RH games I baught for his birthday. I have no doubt he'll love them too.
