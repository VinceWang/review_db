review/summary: I love playing it - even without my five year old daughter
review/text: When my daughter wanted this I was against it. We have Barbie Swan Lake software and it does very little and I was not impressed. After seeing it many times on her "wish list" I warned her that it would most likely be boring. Boy was I wrong! We have spent many rainy day hours decorating rooms and having such fun. You can do so much and make it so different each time. We decide on colors and themes of rooms and go to town. I gave her a big hug and kiss for being so persistant about getting this software. I highly recommend it!
