review/summary: Yasunori Mitsuda is Extremely Talented
review/text: I know many other posts have already said this, but it can't be said enough how great this soundtrack is. This is the best soundtrack for a game ever. Yasunori Mitsuda did a brilliant job with this. This is worth every penny. I've played this for people who don't play video games and the reaction is the same. "This was written for a video game?!"
