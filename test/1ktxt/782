review/text: My older sister had Henry when she was a baby. She still has it to this day. For one of her baby shower gifts, me and my mom ordered Henry so that she can give it to her won daughter. She was brought to tears. This is a great gift for the young and for the young at heart. I am so glad that my niece will get to have the same joy that my sister had with her Henry.
