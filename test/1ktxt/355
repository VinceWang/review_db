review/summary: Disappointed Romanian!
review/text: This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is "clean and proper" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are "tourist guides" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment.
