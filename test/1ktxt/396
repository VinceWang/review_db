review/summary: Great read
review/text: This book is highly suggested for anyone interested in traditional archery. It is very entertaining and a great reference book. I've read it a couple of times and still reread sections from time to time. It gives insight into the way things were before compound bows, carbon fiber arrows, LED peep sights, etc. Heck, laminated wood was a big deal! Besides the exciting hunting stories, I liked the short course on bow and arrow construction.
