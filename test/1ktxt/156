review/summary: No roy Orbison fan should be without this!
review/text: First of all, Roy's studio recordings of the 60's were absolute marvels, production masterpieces of their time, and all time. But Roy was also no slouch live, as Black and White Night proved, once and for all. These recordings are of surprisingly good sound quality, and Roy is in good form throughout. If you're a Roy fan, don't hesitate; the price is great and it's all very listenable. Given an extra star because it's NOT overpriced. I wish the corporate giants would take note: it is not necessary to gauge the buyer on old reissues or old &quot;found&quot; material. You'll sell more, which means in the long run, make more. Get it?
