review/text: Bill Harvey has a wonderful gift of making history come alive in this book. This book awakens a sense of wonder at the possiblility of a real relationship with God as you follow the faithfulness of one little girl in ancient times. Young girls ages 5-15 will love this book. It has always been one of my most loved treasures, a real Keeper !
