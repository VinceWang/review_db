review/summary: Oh's what a cereal! (^_^) ...Oh's what a price (O_o)
review/text: Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold...
