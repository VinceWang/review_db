review/summary: Beautiful and very user friendly!
review/text: I bought this for my granddaughter who is not quite 5 yet. She was hooked from the very first minute. She absolutely loves everything about this game. I was impressed with the beautiful colors and endless poosibilities for decorating the castle. The instructions spoken by Rapunzel are simple and easy to follow. I think this is an excellent program for pre-readers who love Barbie.
