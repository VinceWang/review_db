review/text: When i played the game, the first thing that came to my mind was play and play, but in that process i realized that the music was so good that i couldn't stop playing without reapiting some levels to hear the same music again and again. So i recommend this cd. It is very entertaining and you can eat your favorite meal and listen at the same time great music without getting bored. By the way, the intro is so cool with that music,it makes me dance. I promise you won't regret it. d:D
