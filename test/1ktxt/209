review/summary: Does The Job
review/text: I have had this DVD/VCR combo for a couple of weeks and it does the jobs it is supposed to. Some reviews have said the machine was noisy I have not found this to be the case,I don't even notice the DVD player making noise.It was also easy to set up and comes in crystal clear.The most important aspect for me is that you can record a TV show and watch a DVD at the same time.Some reviews stated that the VCR did not play back recorded shows well especialy if it was recorded on another vcr, I have not found this to be the case. If you do you may not have set the tape to the right speed,you have to do it manualy.The one thing that bugs me is when you have the timer program on and you want to use the vcr you have to shut the timer off and when your done turn it on again or your prgrams will not record.
