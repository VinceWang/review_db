review/summary: pretty good, especially for the younger kids (2-3 years plus)
review/text: I think this one is our favourite game for my younger daughter. She could play this when she was 2.5 years and loved it. It may be a bit simple for the older kids (6+) as they will do it fairly quickly as there are not many challenges or puzzles to solve.This is more of an art game than a challenge game - lots of decorating with the 6 different paintbrushes (each creates a different scene) and there are many decorate it yourself items like making flowers for the garden, making the masks and the decorating the thrones. There is no wrong way to do them (you can't get decorating wrong like you can with the puzzles).The only negative would be the maze at the end, you have to move with the arrow keys and this I always have to help her with as it is a bit difficult. The graphics are great, sound great and my favourite is most of the game is done with the mouse so it is easy for kids (not like the Pegasus game which is terrible!). Older kids may prefer the Princess and the Pauper game if they want a game that lasts longer.
