review/summary: Great for a first camera
review/text: The camera is very easy to use. It's not as bulky as other reviews make it out to be. The battery life has been great and the picture clarity has been great also. I have been using it to tape track meets and everything can be seen clearly. Remember that you will have to buy tapes for this camera, but that is no problem for the clarity you will get. I have not tried out all the other features like night vision, but from what I have seen so far, this camera is a real good bargain. I know 5 other people who have the same item and they do not have any complaints.The flip out lcd screen is clear also. It's like using a digital camera...but only with the tapes. Only downside I have seen is that it is a little hard to keep steady based on the videos watched. The camera seems to move around alot, but again, the picture clarity is great regardless of the low price. If you don't want to upgrade to ditigal, start with this camcorder. You will not be disappointed.
