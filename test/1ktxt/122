review/summary: Really Enjoyed it !
review/text: A great find, heard of this movie from a friend, and glad I did. A really well done romantic comedy with a magical twist. The acting is terrific (I regognized the girl from the Sopranos), the scenery/locations were beautiful and the story held up the whole way. A great date movie. You won't be sorry.
