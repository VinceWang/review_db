review/summary: Great camera for the price
review/text: Wanted a camera for Christmas and got this one because of the price, and needless to say it's a great camera. Just got back from DisneyWorld and the 108 performed extremely well. The nightshot proved handy in those dark rides, and the quality of picture was well for the Festival of the Lion King performance. The only problem I saw was that the autofocus was slow to adapt at times during those fireworks and laser shows. I didn't expect it to keep up, but it did better than I expected. Talk about impact resistant, I had a hissy when it fell out of the bag into the boat on the pirates of the carribean, but it took a lickin and it's still ticking. Once home, I just connected it to my TV and watched my vacation replay. Great camera for the price, definately worth more. Only thing better is digital. Sony has a winner here.
