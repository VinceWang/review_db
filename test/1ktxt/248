review/summary: Fun Series
review/text: I just finished watching the last episode of series 1 of the Hotel Babylon program. For the most part, since there are some serious happenings sometimes, this is a fun series to watch. Lots of funny and naughty things going on.The hotel manager, of the five star Hotel Babylon of London, has husband trouble and you find out why in the last episode of series 1. Her assistant has a dark past, but he seems to be overcoming it well. The concierge is a real sharp character. Front desk staff are very amusing. The bartender (Gino) is a very funny Italian guy. Housekeeping is run by a lady that has more than an eye on the assistant manager. Other staff provide good moments as well too.Guests come in all shapes, sizes and "eccentricities". The guy in drag in the first episode was something else. The honeymoon couple who encounter a rat(supplied by staff) are not to be missed, as are many others as the episodes progress.In the last episode of this series, the assistant manager is shot, but he is still alive at least when the episode comes to an end. Guess viewers will have to see series 2 to see how that works out.This is a British series so be ready for edgy humor at times and some great fun as well. They throw in some serious stuff once in a while for good balance.I am looking forward to series 2. I say give it a try!
