review/summary: Solid second entry in A&amp;M Trilogy
review/text: This was the 2nd recording in Hine's early 80's A&amp;M Trilogy. As fine as it is, his first, Immunity, is the better work. This one lacks some of the intensity, and downright scariness that marked some of the previous work. Still, there are some standout tracks such as &quot;The Set-Up&quot; with clever lyrics and a great melody. &quot;Eleven Faces&quot; explodes with a vast sound. &quot;Dark Windows&quot; is set to the sound of a Thunderstorm, and is suitably brooding and haunting. Get this one after Immunity, but well worth having if you like Immunuty.
