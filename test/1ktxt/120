review/summary: A really great CD
review/text: I took out this CD from the library because my friend told me about the song &quot;Si Exceptionnel&quot; and I can honestly say it is an exceptional album.My favorite songs are &quot;Si Exceptionnel&quot; and &quot;Enfer&quot; and there are no real weak points on the album.If you speak French listen to this album-it has some really great lyrics.Five stars.
