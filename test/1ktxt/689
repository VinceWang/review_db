review/text: Letters from home is an awesome CD! We had two soldiers visit us who just got home from Iraq ~ I bought one of these CDs for each of them. We all listened to "Letters from Home" (the title track, LOL) and there wasn't a dry eye in the room.I'd buy the CD for that one song alone ~ EXCEPT that ALL the songs are great!!!! Soooo...buy it! :)
