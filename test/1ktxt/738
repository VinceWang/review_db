review/summary: Solid reference material for someone planning a build
review/text: I have somewhere over a dozen titles on timber frame construction. This is the one I keep referring back to when it comes to my own construction plans. It is not written as a commercial for the next timber frame workshop as many of these books are. It shows several different building and roof styles rather than a single one. Good detail on joints and joinery as well as planning figures are included. All in all this book is excellent reference material for someone actually wishing to build.
