review/summary: Great advice on caring for your Birman
review/text: I bought this to help understand care issues specific to the Birman breed, and it really helped. The section on exhibition was interesting, but not really relevant to my needs. It was great to have sections on feeding, grooming, temperament, and health that were tailored specifically to the Birman, since this breed of cat is very unique. It goes into detail on health issues of the Birman such as the breed's propensity for kidney disease and the importance of annual blood work. The book also talks about the gentle nature of this cat and how it needs the companionship of humans much more than other breeds and how easily a Birman can get its feelings hurt and even pout. Grooming tips are given on how to take care of the thick yet fine coat of the Birman. I've found it to be the best book on cat care out there for the Birman and I highly recommend it.
