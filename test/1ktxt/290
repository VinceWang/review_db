review/summary: You can't pick which parts you want to play!
review/text: I got this for my 4 year old son because he really likes Rescue Heroes and it sounded like it would have some adventures for him.What the description doesn't tell you is that you can't pick which activities you want to play. You have to complete one part before you can go to the next which just doesn't make sense for this age group. There are certain parts he has no interest in or are too challenging so he gets frustrated and can't get to play the parts he does enjoy. The graphics for the different rescues are very basic and each time you go through the sequence it's exactly the same stuff, so even if he could do it I think it would get boring fast. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that my son has enjoyed watching it (while I play it). If you're looking for something your child can do easily by themselves without getting frustated - don't get it. Almost all of the play involves using the arrow keys instead of the mouse. If your child has no problem with the arrow keys, he might not have trouble.
