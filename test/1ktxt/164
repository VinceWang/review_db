review/summary: Super product! I'm very happy.
review/text: The batteries are excellent (1850's), and the charger is super fast, and stops charging when done. I love that you just plug the unit right into the wall with no unruly cords. My Sony digital only takes 2 AA batteries, so with this charger, I always have two sets of spare batteries with me in my case. This charger even charges up my SONY AA batteries that came with the camera.Highly recommended!
