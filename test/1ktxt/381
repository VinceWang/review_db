review/text: Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2" OD copper pipe.0 Star because they won't accept returns on it.5 stars because I figure it's actually worth $12-15/foot and since they won't take a return I figure I can sell it and make $40-50 on this deal
