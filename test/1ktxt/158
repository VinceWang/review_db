review/summary: Kudos to Orbison Records!
review/text: Thank you for realizing the importance of sharing Roy Orbison live performances with his fans. I especially couldnt believe what an excellent value for 4 CDs... As a true Roy Orbison fan I am thrilled to be able to experience the passion and flawless vocal delivery of his live performances. I truly feel like I am in the audience. I never tire of hearing his hits and its very cool to hear him add his own personal style to other classic songs like &quot;Help Me Rhonda.&quot; Incredible experience~fantastic value!
