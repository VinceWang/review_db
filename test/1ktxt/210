review/text: I bought this unit for one reason - to play back DVD's I write with my HP DVD200i DVD+RW drive. The unit's specs don't mention DVD+RW but it's there. The MP3 quality is also excellent through my Bose system. It would have been nice if the MP3 directory wasn't limited to 200 titles per CD but not really a problem. Great unit.
