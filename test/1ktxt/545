review/summary: Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!
review/text: I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their "rock" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their "2 Many DJs" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, "Nite Versions" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release "Nite Version" on 12" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming "Sexor" debut...?
