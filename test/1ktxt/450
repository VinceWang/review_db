review/summary: This is an excellent game!!
review/text: If you haven't already gotten this game for either your child or yourself, I personally recommend it VERY much. It is one of the best computer games for children I have ever seen. I recently got it for my daughter, and it is a very interesting game. There are lots of activities on the game, even printable items. It is a great learning game for any child because, while they think it's a fun game, it also teaches children some basic computer and everyday skills. I love this and I'm a mother, so I'm sure that you will be satisfied with this. I was very surprised at how great it is. I suggest that if you are looking for a great computer game for a young one, this would be THE one to get. I really recommend this!!
