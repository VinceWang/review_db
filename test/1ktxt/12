review/summary: An amazing OST!! Perfect in every way!
review/text: I played Chrono Cross a year ago. It was and still is my favorite video game of all time, not because of the thought provoking story, not the memorable cast, what left me crying after a sad scene, or jumping for joy after a stunning victory, was the amazing aural sounds composed by Mitsuda. This man is a genious, combining amazing genres of music into a compilation of tracks that will please any person, even if they don't enjoy instrumental music. Words cannot express some of the emotions the music convey's. Perhaps I love it so much because it is a reminder, a wonderful reminiscent that makes my mind soar whenever I remember where I heard a track in the game, and how the music helped that portion of the game impact my emotions. After listening to this CD, I am certain that the music is the single most important part of any video game, because without it, there is nothing except a group of people talking in silent text, with nothing in the background to make the scene intriguing and/or emotionally impacting. I urge all music fans to buy this CD. For the wonderful music you will have the privelage to listen to, no price can be put. This is truly a priceless experience.
