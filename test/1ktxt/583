review/summary: Don't be confused by album cover
review/text: Caution. This album cover is almost exactly like the album cover for Deodato In Concert, which has different songs on it (it seems both albums have Do it Again and Spirit of Summer). If you're looking for Also Sprach Zarathustra, buy the other In Concert album (or Prelude). This album has Deodato on side 1, Airto on side 2(and I'm talking about the vinyl version, which I just bought at a thrift shop. I'm not talking about the CD). Different bands on each side. As for the music...it's OK. I give it a 3 out of 5 stars. Can't beat thrift shop price of $1 for vinyl albums.
