review/summary: Excellent charger and top-of-the-line batteries
review/text: I have really enjoyed using these 1850 NiMH Batteries - they last quite a long time in my A70 digital camera and CD player and the charge time is very quick compared to others. Plus, the fact that you can charge each battery individually is very nice, since it prevents overcharging of any battery. Others charge 2 batteries at once and that assumes that both need to charge as long as the other. Also, the charger works well with AA and AAA NiCad and NiMH batteries. Great buy...
