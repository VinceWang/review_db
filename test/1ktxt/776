review/summary: Good Old Henry
review/text: My son is 37 now. When he was a little guy, he had Henry. We had to take Henry everywhere. He talked to him, and he blamed things on Henry. When I saw this a few months ago, I got him a 3" one. Well he hung it on his mirror in his truck. Since then we found out my son has cancer. He will be starting chemo soon. I ordered a big Henry for him to have something to hold on to when he has a bad day. Please pray for my son Bob. Thank you and God Bless !!!!
