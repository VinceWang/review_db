review/summary: Mitsuda's best soundtrack yet
review/text: OK, you know how in my review of Xenogears' soundtrack I said it was my second favorite? Well this is number one. There are so many excellent pieces of music on this OST it will literally blow your mind and leave you twitching like a goldfish out of the water. Well, maybe not, but really good nonetheless. My favorite tracks are &quot;People Seized With Life&quot;, &quot;Time's Scar&quot;, &quot;Magical Dreamers&quot;, &quot;Home Gardov&quot; and a whole plethora of others. So, get it, for cryin' out loud!
