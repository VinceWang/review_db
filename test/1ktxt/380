review/text: To listen to the Reatards second record, &quot;grown up, fucked up&quot;, is to be able to place your head inside a black and white Zenith television set with your mouth wide open and choke on the dusty cables inside. Each song is nothing but a teaser of such maniacal rock frenzy fuzz that is barely tolerable, even to the strong at heart. But, thats the beauty. Memphis never sounded so good being portrayed by three lads who stare at the sun, while sweating out electric frustration on their living room floors.
