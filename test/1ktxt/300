review/summary: A must read for anyone with blood pressure issues
review/text: Books by Dr Kenneth Cooper have been a tremendous source of guidance for me for over 30 years.When I first started being affected by the stress side effects of working too hard and too long in the 70's I started exercising. At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book "Aerobics" (a term he coined), then to "Aerobics Program for total Well Being...", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book "Start Strong, Finish Strong" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading.
