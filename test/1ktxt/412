review/summary: Scraped across the whole top.
review/text: Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.
