review/summary: Yasunori Mitsuda's soothing, classical masterwork.
review/text: While not associated with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Yasunori Mitsuda has still become a legend for his musical works on Square titles. His legendary works include the soundtracks to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Xenogears&quot;, and joining that prestigious list is the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack. Spanning three discs worth of music, the soundtrack to &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; is a soothing, classical masterwork.The first thing that listeners will notice about the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack is that the music is very mild compared to, say, the music of &quot;Xenogears&quot;. That's not saying that there aren't any fast-paced tracks on this soundtrack, but overall the music doesn't demand a powerful emotional response using heavy instrumentation and bass. Instead, the soundtrack uses soothing, gentle melodies to envoke an emotional response, and even during fast-paced songs the feeling of calmness remains. Each song is a work of art, and while some songs are more memorable than others, they all play their part to paint a tapestry of unforgettable sound.One of the soundtrack's greatest accomplishments is the way it sounds. Mitsuda's previous masterpieces always gave the modest impression that, despite the excellence of the melodies, the songs were played using synth-like instruments. The &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack rarely, if ever, does that. Although some instrumentation obviously sounds synth-like, the listener can somehow believe that the songs sound orchestrated. Mitsuda's demonstrated his talent for putting quality, life-like music in the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; game when it was released on the PSX, and that quality has carried over to this marvelous soundtrack.If there is one flaw with the soundtrack, it's that is might be TOO gentle. Some people might be put off by the idea of listening to roughly three hours of gentle music with just a few fast tracks to speed things up. Even the soundtrack's vocal song, &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;, is slow-paced, and while some people may like it, others may feel the lack of multiple instrumentation (the song uses only an acoustic guitar) actually ruins it. However, if you take the time to listen to the soundtrack, it will grow on you.All in all, the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack is another one of Yasunori Mitsuda's masterpieces. While it may take a couple of tries to get used to the overall gentleness of the music, once it grows on you, you won't be able to stop listening to it. Along with &quot;Xenogears&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; is an absolute must-have soundtrack.
