review/summary: There's Only One Paolo
review/text: As a Celtic and West Ham nut-case I have had the pleasure of watching Paolo play for 2 of my clubs! His passion and skill are unmatched, and his unpredictable antics are a bonus. When he was happy, West Ham were in the Top ten in the Prem. When he was un-happy West Ham were relegated. When he left, West Ham lost it's soul. I pray his last year is played in MLS for San Jose!!!
